biography: >-
  <p><i>Corentin is a student at the Institute of Mechanics in Paris, where he is pursuing an engineering degree. Deeply interested in the concept of post-growth, he aims to integrate this perspective with his engineering background in preparation for a future PhD.</i><i>During his studies, he specialized in eco-design and the ethics of technology and science. He also initiated projects at his school based on post-growth principles, with the goal of bringing new perspectives to the field of engineering.</i><i>From mid-March to early September, Corentin will be interning at the Post-Growth Innovation Lab. There, among other tasks, he will assist Mario Pansera with the Prospera project, helping to analyze a database of post-growth innovations.</i><i>Outside of his academic and professional pursuits, Corentin enjoys playing volleyball and has begun training with Pontevedra's senior volleyball team. He is also passionate about tabletop roleplaying games, which allow him to create and explore imaginary worlds-challenging conventional ideas about how societies function.</i><i></i>   </p>
