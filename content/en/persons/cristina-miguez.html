biography: >-
  <p>Cristina Míguez González combines studies in Biology, Environmental Education, and Sustainable Development Management with extensive training in Equality and a master's degree in Neuroeducation. Since completing her Biology studies, Cris has accumulated over six years of experience dedicated to teaching and knowledge transfer. In 2016, she embarked on her journey at the Environmental Office of the University of Vigo, coordinating outreach activities and environmental education in schools in Galicia. Subsequently, she has worked in the private sector designing and coordinating various educational projects in Equality. At the same time, she has directed a Leisure and Free Time School, where she has served as a teacher in multiple subjects related to the environment, gender equality, and musical expression. In between, she has taught Spanish as a foreign language, working as an independent professional. In a way, this has allowed her to travel around the world. Currently, she is part of the Postgrowth Innovation Lab research group, leading the coordination and execution of the Postgrowth S.A project: Pontevedra, a citizen science project investigating various challenges that cities face in the ecological transition.  </p>
