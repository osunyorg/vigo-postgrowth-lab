biography: >-
  <p> Ana  has a double BSc in Advertising and Public Relations with Marketing  from Rey Juan Carlos University and an MSc in Economic Development  and Innovation, specializing in Sustainable Development and Circular  Economy from the University of Santiago de Compostela. During these  years, she learned ecological economics and sustainable transition  futures. In her master's thesis, she mixed these disciplines  with her previous knowledge in critical communication studies and the  importance of framing in shaping societal shared meanings. <br>  In  the coming years, Ana aims to investigate how alternative discourses,  such as degrowth and post-growth narratives, are framed and how their  meanings are  reproduced. Her goal is to understand how these views can overcome the  predominant understanding of the ecological crisis, which is based on  perpetuating growth and reproducing unjust and asymmetrical power  relations. <br>  Ana  has experience working in marketing, hospitality, and retail. She  enjoys spending her free time reading, indulging in creative activities,  and taking long walks in nature. </p>
