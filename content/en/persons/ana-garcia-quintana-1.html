<p> Ana has a double BSc in Advertising and Public Relations with Marketing from Rey Juan Carlos University and an MSc in Economic Development and Innovation, specializing in Sustainable Development and Circular Economy from the University of Santiago de Compostela. During these years, she learned ecological economics and sustainable transition futures. In her master's thesis, she mixed these disciplines with her previous knowledge in critical communication studies and the importance of framing in shaping societal shared meanings. <br> In the coming years, Ana aims to investigate how alternative discourses, such as degrowth and post-growth narratives, are framed and how their meanings are reproduced. Her goal is to understand how these views can overcome the predominant understanding of the ecological crisis, which is based on perpetuating growth and reproducing unjust and asymmetrical power relations. <br> Ana has experience working in marketing, hospitality, and retail. She enjoys spending her free time reading, indulging in creative activities, and taking long walks in nature. <br></p>
