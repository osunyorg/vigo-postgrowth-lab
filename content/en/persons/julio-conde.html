biography: >-
  <p>Júlio Conde holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering, with a doctoral dissertation on hydrogen-based renewable technologies. He is currently part of the ATTRACT project at the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, which examines the Right to Repair movement and its role in the transition toward a postgrowth society. Previously, he held a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral position focused on environmental education, with research interests in climate change education, energy transition, and the history and theoretical foundations of environmental education. During his postdoctoral career in both industry and academia, he has also worked on life cycle assessment of products and processes, as well as on advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. </p>
