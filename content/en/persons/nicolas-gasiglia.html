biography: >-
  <p>Nicolas holds two Master's degrees (Management and Sustainable development). He is currently a third-year PhD candidate at ESCP Business School in Paris, where he explores the transformation of marketing practices in the face of strong sustainability imperatives. His research is conducted under a CIFRE contract with Laboratoires Expanscience, a French dermo-cosmetics company known for its commitment to responsible innovation, and is supervised by Julien Schmitt from the Sustainability Department at ESCP Business School. Before entering academia, Nicolas built a 16-year career in the food industry. For 14 years, he held various marketing positions, leading projects in business strategy, innovation, and brand equity management. In the final two years of his corporate career, he served as Sustainability Director for Carte Noire (Lavazza Group). This experience deepened his desire to understand how companies can transform their core practices to align with ecological limits and societal well-being.Through his doctoral research, Nicolas adopts a practice-based and reflexive approach to investigate the organizational tensions, adaptations, and potential reorientations of marketing work in companies that aim to adopt a strong sustainability approach.  </p>
