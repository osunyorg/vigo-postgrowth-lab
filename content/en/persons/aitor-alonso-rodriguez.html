<p>Aitor has a bachelor on Political Science and Administration (at the University of Santiago in Spain). He holds a Master on Management of Sustainable Development (at the University of Vigo in Spain). He participated in the European Volunteer Service, going as a volunteer to Narve, Estonia for a year. He worked as a teleoperator for a year after that. His academic interests are around theories of power and ecological economics. Over the next few years, he will study the influence of power and how much impact it has in the ecological transition. Beyond Academia, Aitor writes as a hobby and published a book in the past.  <br></p>
