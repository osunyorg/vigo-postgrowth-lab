biography: >-
  <p>André holds a MA in International Political Economy (King's College London), a BA in Politics and Portuguese (University of Bristol) and a BSc in Economics (UNED). He has been a PhD candidate in International Political Economy at King's College London since October 2022, under the supervision of Dr Thomas Purcell and Professor Alex Loftus. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through LISS-DTP, his project critically examines the transition to renewable energy in Brazil and Mexico from the perspective of these countries' insertion within global capitalism.More generally, André is interested in and developing and applying the critique of political economy in relation to the limits and contradictions inherent to capital accumulation in different economic activities and geographic spaces, with a particular attention to politico-ecological questions.While completing his doctoral studies, André has also worked as a GTA for different modules in the Department of European and International Studies and Department of International Development, as well as a research assistant to Professor Engelbert Stockhammer.Outside academia, André has worked as a consultant in the fields public policy, economics and development.  </p>
