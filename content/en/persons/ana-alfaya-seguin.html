biography: >-
  <p>She studied Biology at UVigo, with Erasmus and Free Mover stays at the Universidade dos Açores. She also completed a Master's in Marine Biology at UVigo, a Master's in Teaching (Biology and Geology) at the University Isabel I of Castilla and a Master's in Management in Sustainable Development at UVigo. </p><p>Professionally, she has been associated with UVigo several times, with a training scholarship and an ‘Investigo’ contract. Before joining the group, she worked for a year and a half in a passive vehicle safety company, where she initially focused on tasks related to the decarbonisation of the supply chain and the circular economy of materials, and then focused on human rights in the supply chain (conflict minerals, critical raw materials, etc.). </p><p>Her work will focus on the Right to Repair (R2R) of electronic products as part of the ATTRACT project, exploring how restrictions on repair impact consumer rights, environmental sustainability and economic structures, particularly in the European Union. The project ultimately aims to provide practical recommendations for a progressive Right to Repair policies, as well as alternative pathways for technological governance beyond dependence on economic growth. </p>
