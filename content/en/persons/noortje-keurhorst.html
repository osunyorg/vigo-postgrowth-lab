biography: >-
  <p>Noor pursued her bachelor's degree in International Business Administration at the Erasmus University Rotterdam after which she opted for a different study direction during her master's degree, namely Environmental Sciences at Wageningen University. In Wageningen she majored in Environmental Economics and pursued two minors as part of the MSc Organic Agriculture: Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. She wrote her MSc thesis about the Social Solidarity Economy in the Netherlands, undertaking two case studies with groups seeking to change the food system towards more agroecological and social ends. At the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, Noor is pursuing a PhD relevant to environmental governance and political ecology, focusing on different imaginaries of the Galician monte. Her PhD engages with forestry science, commons communities (Comunidades de montes), and activists working towards the eradication of eucalyptus, to consider what different futures are imagined for the Galician monte.  </p>
