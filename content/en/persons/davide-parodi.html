biography: >-
  <p>Davide Parodi holds a bachelor's degree in International Relations at the University of Bologna (Italy) with an Erasmus+ at Science Po Rennes (France). Currently he is a student at the Erasmus Mundus master's degree in "Climate Change and Diversity: Sustainable Territorial Development", a joint program of the University of Padova (Italy) and the Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar based in Quito (Ecuador). His studies deal with sustainable territorial development in the context of global climate and environmental emergencies. Specifically, he is focusing, on the one hand, on mitigation policies to climate change with participatory democracy and post-growth approaches. On the other hand, on the assessment of alternatives to development considering ecological economy approaches applied to the context of the indigenous Waorani territory in the Ecuatorian amazon forest.       </p>
