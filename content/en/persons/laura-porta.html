biography: >-
  <p>Laura holds a BSc in Economics from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, as well as a joint MSc in Innovation Management from the University of Trento and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa.      Due to her interest in public policy, after working in a startup she decided to join the Italian Ministry of University and Research as a policy innovation analyst, which afterwards lead her to the choice of starting a PhD at Politecnico di Milano to study Research and Innovation governance in public sector organizations. Her aim is to delve into the organizational aspects of governing R&amp;I towards societal challenges, understanding the critical role of public actors in driving collective change but also the everyday tensions and complexities faced. By using an action-oriented approach, she aims at building critical knowledge and capacity together with public managers and officers, co-exploring novel ways to organize and govern R&amp;I for the common good.      Beyond her PhD research, Laura enjoys swing and jazz dances, practices yoga and is active in two youth associations, one dealing with youth engagement and participation in the public sector, and the other seeking to reimagine an educational system at the core of society, promoting discussion and participation, fully accessible, combatting inequalities, and fostering the development of individuals and communities.       <br></p>
