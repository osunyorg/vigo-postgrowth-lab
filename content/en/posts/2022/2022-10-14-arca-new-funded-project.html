    <p>  <br>Our postdoctoral researcher David Soto has received funding by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation to develop this new project and dilucidate how the appropriate responsibility narrative can affect the behaviour of public administrations in the face of climate change The purpose of ARCA project is to help local administrations determine their territories’ share of responsibility for climate change and to assess the effect that this narrative of appropriate responsibility has on their public policy commitments towards mitigation. Different types of interventions will be carried out on random samples of municipalities in Spain, to assess how the communication of a precise appropriate responsibility affects the willingness of the actor to take on climate commitments. During 24 months, a group of researchers from University of Vigo and University of A Coruña, led by David Soto and Mario Pansera will contribute to this study. Click here to  learn more</p>
