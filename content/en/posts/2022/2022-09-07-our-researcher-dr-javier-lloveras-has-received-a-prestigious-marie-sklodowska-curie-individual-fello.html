        <p>During the next 24 months, Javier Lloveras will carry out his own research project titled “<strong>Right to repair for a post-growth society: Controversies, opportunities and challenges -R2R4postgrowth</strong>” at the Post growth Innovation Lab, with the supervision of our coordinator <strong>Dr Mario Pansera</strong>.</p><p>The project, fully aligned with the interest of our Lab, will study how emerging discourses and practices around the <strong>“right to repair” </strong>can support the transition towards a postgrowth society – where the relations between consumers, manufacturers, and technologies would be reshaped. With a clear social and ecological interest, the project will help tackle the root-cause of the e-waste problem.</p>
