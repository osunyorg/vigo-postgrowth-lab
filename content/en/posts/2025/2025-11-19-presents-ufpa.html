    <p>  <br>Post growth and degrowth scholars argue that we cannot reduce CO2 emissions fast enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees while continuing economic growth. We face a choice: either we innovate how to scale down production and consumption equitably, or we risk severe environmental and social consequences. Yet the role of innovation remains largely unexplored within contemporary post growth debates. This book fills that gap, examining the narratives, processes, and practices needed to break free from the growth imperative. It offers a bridge for understanding the far-reaching implications of technological and scientific advancements in a society that challenges economic growth as its central focus. El libro, que saldrá a la venta el próximo martes 25 de noviembre, está editado por el departamento de Prensa de la Universidad de Bristol.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>GET THE BOOK <br>https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/post-growth-innovation</p>
