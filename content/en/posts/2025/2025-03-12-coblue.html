    The CoBlue project begins It is intended to contribute to the European mission Restore our Ocean and Waters.
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The aim of CoBlue (Co-creating knowledge and politics in the blue economy) is to develop, test and refine a method of public participation that makes it possible to involve all stakeholders of the so-called quadruple helix (public administration, private sector, science and civil society) in the implementation of offshore wind energy in south-west Galicia. The project is part of the Open and Responsible Innovation Initiatives (ORRI). To this end, a community forum will be set up, made up of representatives from different entities of the quadruple helix, who will analyse the current situation, share their different visions and realities and jointly draw up a proposal for recommendations to integrate ORRI into the development of offshore wind energy over the course of three joint working sessions. The initiative, coordinated by researcher Brais Suárez Eiroa, aims to contribute to the European mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and is being developed in collaboration between the University of Vigo and CITTA-Porto (Research Centre for Territory, Transport and Environment). On the University of Vigo side, the project involves researchers from different research groups, including the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, the Future Oceans Lab (FOL), the Governance and Economics Research Network (GEN) and Biological Oceanography. CoBlue is funded by Reinforcing (Responsible Territories and Institutions eNable and Foster Open Research and inClusive Innovation for traNsitions Governance), a European project developed under the Horizon Europe programme and coordinated by the Giannino Bassetti Foundation.</p>
