    <p>  <br>Proposals can now be submitted under the Special Sessions/Tracks call. The deadline is October 16, 2023. Special Sessions aim to give space within the Conference to special tracks that are not among those proposed by the organization, sessions with a unique topic and format, or groups of people that want to present the progress or results of a specific project. We invite special sessions that provide artistic or interactive avenues to learn, debate, and co-create in transdisciplinary manners, such as dancing, futuring, visioning, painting, sculpture, songwriting, theatre, improv, poetry, backcasting, world cafés, board games, yoga and meditation etc. Any person can submit a proposal for organizing a Special Session or propose a Special Track (topics related to degrowth and ecological economics but not clearly fitting with any of the  tracks  proposed by the conference organizers). The  deadline for submitting proposals is October 16, 2023 . More info and submissions:  https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/the-conference/program/special-sessions-call/</p>
