        <p>In April, the Post-growth Innovation Lab hosted a workshop on ‘Post-growth/degrowth organisation” within the framework of our project <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/prospera/">PROSPERA</a>. The workshop brought together over 20 international researchers exploring what post-growth and degrowth means for organisations and organising during 3 intensive days.</p>
