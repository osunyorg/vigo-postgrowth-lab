    <p>  <br>For this team, 2024 was a memorable year in which great things happened: ☑️ We hosted the  ESEE-Degrowth 2024 International Conference . With more than 1200 participants, we are very proud of the work done and the unforgettable moments we experienced last June ( https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/news/2024-10-08-esee-degrowth-2024-video/ ). ✅ We have  successfully completed two of our projects :  <br> The  JUST2CE  project, funded by the EU ( https://just2ce.eu/ )   <br> The Post-Growth S.A. - Pontevedra project, co-funded by the  Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología, FECYT  ( https://postgrowthsa.webs.uvigo.es/postgrowthsapontevedra/ )  <br> ☑️  Two new projects  have been launched:  <br> The  SERIGO Project , funded by the EU ( https://www.serigo-project.eu/ )  <br> The Post-Growth S.A. - Vigo project, co-funded by the FECYT ( https://postgrowthsa.webs.uvigo.es/postgrowthsavigo/ )  <br> ✅ We have received  funding to start two new projects next year :  <br> The ATTRACT project, funded by the  Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades    <br> The CoBlue project, funded as part of the cascade call for proposals of the European  REINFORCING Project    <br> ☑️ 25 new publications have been issued, including articles, books and book chapters ( https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/publications/ ) ✅ We have further strengthened the internationalisation of the group by receiving the visit of 9 researchers from centres abroad and carrying out research stays in 8 centres from 5 different countries. ☑️ We have added new members to our team: Aitor Alonso Rodríguez, Tess Doezema, Ana García Quintana, Sebastián Iturriaga Gazol and Carmen Rey Mayo. All these successes are thanks to the  great team  that made them possible. We're going on holiday for a few days to recharge our batteries, but we're looking forward to coming back and seeing what 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣5️⃣ has in store for us.   🫎🌲 We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy, Fair and Degrowth New Year ! </p>
