  Join us for this year's Global Degrowth Day! In the opening ceremony, we will have the chance to pay our respects to local and international activists, who will read their manifestos for this day. Later, after a full day of researching, discussing and protesting on the limits to growth, we will have time for community building, emotional care and tension relief under some music.
