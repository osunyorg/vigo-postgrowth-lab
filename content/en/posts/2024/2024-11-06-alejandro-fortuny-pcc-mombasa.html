        <p>The PCC 2024 conference is being held in Mombasa under the title “Digital Africa Rising”. The event envisions a future where digital transformation is seen as a crucial chapter in a broader story of justice, aligned with co-operative principles and values to drive progress in infrastructure, education, healthcare, agriculture and technology.</p><p>Alejandro Fortuny, PhD student at the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, has been invited to this conference where he will participate in the session “AI Co-ops and Platform Co-ops: Paradoxes of Governance”. Fortuny is developing his research in the field of cooperativism and was selected this year as a research fellow by the Institute of <a href="https://platform.coop/blog/coopcycle-navigating-political-democratic-and-economic-realities/">Institute of Cooperative Digital Economy (ICDE)</a>. The conference will give him the opportunity to look in depth at self-management as a critical alternative to mainstream management in order to prove that more democratic forms of economy and organisation beyond economic growth are possible and desirable. He will explain his findings at this event using one of his cases of study, CoopCycle, a federation of bicycle logistics messengers providing services to cooperatives and social economy organisations active in bicycle logistics.</p>
