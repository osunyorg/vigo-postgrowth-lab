  Developing nations face a complex challenge in acquiring energy and ensuring universal access to clean and reliable energy sources. This study presents a systematic scoping review that employs a multi-dimensional framework, integrating energy access indicators (availability, accessibility, affordability, and reliability) with multiple dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic, environmental, and cultural) framework to analyze these challenges. We further explore the interplay between the indicators and dimensions using two theoretical lenses: the Energy Justice Framework and the Socio-Technical Systems Approach. The analysis highlights the interconnected nature of energy access challenges, where limitations in one indicator (e.g., affordability) can significantly impact others (e.g., accessibility). This interconnectedness underscores the importance of integrated strategies across multiple Sustainable Development dimensions. Key barriers to progress include financial constraints (economic dimension), lack of technical expertise (social dimension), and inadequate policy frameworks (impacting all dimensions). Drawing on insights from the theoretical frameworks, this study recommends a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes not only investments in renewable energy sectors but also strategies to address specific limitations within each dimension. By implementing these recommendations and fostering a holistic understanding of the energy challenge, a more just and sustainable energy future—addressing social equity, economic viability, environmental sustainability, and cultural appropriateness—can be achieved in developing nations. The paper concludes by calling for further research into specific energy access challenges, such as governance and political stability in energy transitions, assessing climate change impacts on renewable energy adoption, and enhancing the understanding of systemic challenges to sustainable energy access in developing nations.
