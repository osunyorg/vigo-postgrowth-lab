  Abstract This discussion paper confronts some of the foundational contradictions of Responsible Innovation (RI) through the case of Palestine's techno-colonial occupation. I argue that RI's current community risks to remain complicit in colonial violence if keep ignoring the entanglement of contemporary high-tech development with colonial oppression and dispossession. I suggest that RI's conceptual tools often fail when confronted with contexts where technological development is inseparable from ecocide, epistemicide and genocide. Building on this critique, I propose a decolonial reorientation of RI that rejects the myth of technological neutrality and instead centers old and contemporary forms of coloniality as constitutive of technoscience. This requires moving beyond ethics-washing toward material accountability for innovation's role in oppression. My fear is that the absence of a clear and widely shared position within the RI community on the genocide occurring in Gaza risks to amply and legitimise the neoliberal and colonial blindspots that characterise part of the academic production in the field. Gaza compels us to ask: can there be RI without abolition of the colonial structures that make such violence possible?.
