  Although the circular economy (CE) aims to address ecological and social challenges of our times, a narrow focus on technical solutions risks perpetuating the structures that underpin today’s eco-social crisis. Achieving a fair and sustainable CE therefore requires approaches that go beyond business-as-usual and consider the deeper economic, social and political dimensions of circularity. In this regard, Techniques of Futuring (ToFs) are powerful tools for envisioning and co-creating alternative pathways. To date, much of circular futures research has relied on static, scenario-based planning that successfully identifies possible endpoints, but not how to navigate from the present to a transformative future. By systematically integrating ToFs such as backcasting, Delphi and SWOT analyses, researchers and practitioners can identify the necessary policy measures, technological innovations and cultural shifts to realise an equitable and ecologically sound CE. This action-oriented perspective is essential to overcome current limitations, guide societal change and ensure that the CE becomes a genuinely inclusive and sustainable paradigm.
