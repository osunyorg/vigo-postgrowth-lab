  The paper reviews the ongoing bio-fuel policy initiatives in India in relation to first and second-generation bio-ethanol and compressed bio-gas. The efforts made at the national policy level are critically analysed in relation to environmental concerns, impacts on agriculture, regulatory framework and public engagement. The paper provides specific recommendations to be taken into consideration while thinking about the agri-energy-water-waste nexus.
