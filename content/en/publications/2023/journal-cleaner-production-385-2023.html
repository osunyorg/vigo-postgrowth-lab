  In April 2022, the European Commission (EC) published a set of policy proposals to foster the European Union's (EU) transition to the circular economy (CE). Despite significant academic debate on the implications of transitioning to the CE, there remains little empirical and theoretical knowledge about what kind of circular future the EC policy proposals prescribe. In this paper, we explore the circular futures underpinning the EC policies and strategies on the CE by conducting a content analysis of the EC's CE policies between 2011 and 2022 using Bauwens et al.’s (2020) theoretical approach of circular futures as an analytical framework. We find that the EC's CE policies result from hybrid combinations of often competing, different circular futures. Despite this hybridity, circular modernism imaginaries that rely on techno-optimism and centralised governance tend to dominate, leading to a weak version of the CE that may be unable to meet the EU's environmental ambitions.
