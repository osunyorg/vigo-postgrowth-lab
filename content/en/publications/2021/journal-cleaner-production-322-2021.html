  The goal of this research is to theoretically integrate the CE paradigm within the environmental sustainability framework. Based on the shortcomings detected in the circular economy literature, we followed a three steps procedure. Firstly, we conducted a narrative literature review that underlies the need of understanding the circular economy as a resilient, sustainable and circular economy, and we identified twelve principles to operationalize the circular economy under the environmental sustainability paradigm. Secondly, we created a database containing information on twenty-six strategies of circular economy. Thirdly, we analyzed the data to assess how the principles explored in phase 1 are being considered by the current circular economy strategies. Results revealed a high variability of approaches performed by the governments to reach the circular economy. Moreover, strategies grouped into the resilience domain are barely incorporated into circular economy strategies, and hence some circular economy strategies reveal shortcomings in their capacity to generate real changes. Further research is needed to perform a more holistic analysis based on complex adaptative system thinking, which would allow connecting more essential elements to enhance a socially fair development that preserves the environment.
