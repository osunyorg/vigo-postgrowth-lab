  The scientific literature about circular economy (CE) is scarce yet, and both conceptual discussions and the development of practical strategies for its implementation are still emerging. Although CE systems are currently being implemented, CE goals and principles need to be better considered and translated into actions, and more coordinated actions among different levels of implementation are necessary. In this research we conduct a review of the scientific literature relative to CE and propose operational principles which join the theoretical goals of CE within the sustainable development framework to practical strategies of implementation. This research resulted in seven operational principles: i) adjusting inputs to the system to regeneration rates, ii) adjusting outputs from the system to absorption rates, iii) closing the system, iv) maintaining the value of resources within the system, v) reducing the system's size, vi) designing for CE, and vii) educating for CE. It is important to emphasize the role of design and education as transversal elements. A new definition and a new conceptual model of CE are also proposed.
