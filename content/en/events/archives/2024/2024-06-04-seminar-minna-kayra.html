        <p><i> "I have been given the task to shed light on the sustainability challenges  of long-distance travelling in Finland. Country that is more easily  accessible by flying rather than other less-emitting land-based  modes of travel.</i></p><p>  </p><p><i>In  my presentation, I will present my first paper: Institutionalising  degrowth regime: A review and analysis of degrowth change proposal (in  review process). Here, we wanted to understand  what kind of changes degrowth scholars propose to tackle the pursue of  continuous growth. We ended up drawing the institutional pillars of a  possible degrowth society.</i></p><p>  </p><p><i>Then,  I will present some preliminary results of analysing the long-distance  travelling practices of Finns. Here, I try to understand how the  travelling practices emerge, change and connect.  I pay special attention to the constitution of demand through the range  of practices enacted in society, and on the technologies,  infrastructures and institutions on which these depend".</i></p><p><i>Minna Käyrä</i></p><p><i><br></i>Martes 4 de xuño ás 11:00 a.m.</p><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NjQ0YzVhODktN2QwMi00NWI2LTg3M2QtOTljNTQ1Y2Q3ZDNj%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2256845f80-04d6-428c-98a9-3453edff8a1e%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22d59b7e90-3d3e-4fc9-8873-99f3206dfadf%22%7d" target="_blank">Enlace de retransmisión a TEAMS<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></p>
