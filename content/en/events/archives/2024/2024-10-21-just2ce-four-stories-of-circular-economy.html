summary: >-
  <p>  Over the past decade, the concept of the Circular Economy (CE) has gained significant political traction as a potential solution to the economy-environment tradeoff. However, critical social scientists have expressed concerns that CE may not adequately address the root causes or consequences of environmental degradation, potentially limiting its effectiveness.  Aligned with this discourse, this video highlights key elements of the Just Transition framework through the personal stories of those at the forefront of such transformative change.  </p>
