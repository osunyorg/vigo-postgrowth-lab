Firstly, the idea of science-based speculative futures through a reflection on the way the scientists are helping produce climate futures. Secondly, I want to expand on my ongoing reflection on the role of social science/scientists in large-scale environmental science (Monteiro, 2012,2018,2023; Monteiro &amp; Rajão, 2017). The experiment makes use of Free Air CO2 Enrichment as a proxy for climate futures wherein climate change has run its course. Through large-scale infrastructures, the experiment helps coordinate and coproduce (Jasanoff, 2004)international ‘big science,’ international scientific and climate cooperation, and global horizon work (Petryna, 2018; Petryna, 2022) in and about the Amazon. I will explore the first perceptions of my ongoing engagement with the project, as both a direct participant and a would-be ethnographer of the experiment. I explore the idea of science-based speculation as ways of theorizing how this experimental system helps to produce and materialize climate futures, as well as present (and future) climate governance for Brazil and beyond.</p>
