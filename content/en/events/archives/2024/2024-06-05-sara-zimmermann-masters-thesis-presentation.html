        <p>"I would love to share with you  briefly my research process/outcomes (of my master thesis) so far. The  past few months I looked into Circular Economy in the African-European  "development" cooperation,  considering policy papers and one small case study".</p><p> </p><p>Day/Time: Wednesday 5th June, 11 AM  (at the conference room)</p><p><b>Abstract</b>: </p><p>Since the new Circular Economy  Action Plan of the European Union 2020, the concept of Circular Economy  (CE) has become increasingly relevant in the European-African  “development” apparatus. Building on critical literature  concerning both, CE and the “development” apparatus, this thesis  examines the current CE policy discourse between Africa and the EU.  Additionally, a case study explores a CE “development” project and its  possible implications. The results show that the discourse  is largely in-line with the previously characterized “development”  discourse, being a-political, technological-focused and  standardising/homogenising. The case study results in three themes: (i)  the dumping narrative; (ii) multi-level governance and (iii)  cherry-picking as problem construction. Integrating the results and  existing literature, this paper demonstrates possible social justice  implications, such as enhancing distributional injustice through  disregarding certain risks/costs. Overall, the results  show the importance, multiplicity and interconnectedness of social  justice dimensions for CE within the “development” apparatus.</p><p>      </p><p> </p>
