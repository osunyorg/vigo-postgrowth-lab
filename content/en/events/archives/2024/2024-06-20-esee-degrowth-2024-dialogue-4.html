summary: >-
  <p>  The dialogue will focus on the recent Circular Economy initiatives proposed by the European Union, highlighting current limitations and potential improvements. Panelists will also discuss the emerging tensions between the Circular Economy paradigm and the economic growth imperative, along with policy implications. The need to go beyond simple recycling targets and implementing transformative, but feasible, production and consumption models will also be analysed.  </p>
