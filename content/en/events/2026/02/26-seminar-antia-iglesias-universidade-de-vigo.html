    SEMINAR Antía Iglesias (Universidade de Vigo) Hybrid Territories: Art-Science Devices for the Study of the Contemporary Ecological Environment

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>  In the context of the climate crisis, ecological issues must be investigated and communicated beyond disciplinary boundaries. Addressing this complexity through arts-based research, forest and chemical engineering, and materials science, artist and postdoctoral researcher Antía Iglesias, member of the Dx5 Digital and Graphic Art Research group at the University of Vigo, advocates for collaboration and co-creation as means of interrelating humans and more-than-humans.In this presentation, Iglesias will briefly introduce three of her most recent projects, presenting a practice grounded in the hybridization of artistic and scientific methodologies and perspectives that foster a deeper understanding of the natural environment by unraveling its cultural, ecological, social, and political layers. These projects include:  Graphic Ecosystems : a scientific-artistic research project on the transformation of plant waste from exotic [invasive] species (Faculty of Fine Arts, School of Forest Engineering, University of Vigo);  The Multidimensionality of the Plant: An Art and Ecophysiology Approach to the Comprehension of Amazonian Tree Seedlings  (Unité Mixte de Recherche EcoFog, Tropical Forest Ecology, Université de Guyane, INRAE); and  (In)visible Flows: Light and Water Streams in the Poaceae Family - The Art and Science behind More-than-Human Systems  (Scoffoni Lab, Department of Biological Sciences, Cal State LA).Focused on different fields and issues-whether the question of exotic and invasive species, Amazonian drought, or plant physiology and its relationship with water management-these projects exemplify a dynamic that seeks to unravel the anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems, while also proposing sustainable material alternatives that enable us to propose, speculate, and envision interrelational futures. Furthermore, through a commitment to open and accessible science and art, Iglesias proposes scientific communication through contemporary art, bringing both forms of research closer to the viewer in a sensory and embodied way through large-scale installations and participatory works that build bridges between art, science, and nature.   </p>
