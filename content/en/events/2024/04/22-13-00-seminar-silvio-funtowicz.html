    <p>  <br>Complex political problems: Why Science can’t <br>speak with One Voice   Silvio Funtowicz   Centre for the Study of the Sciences <br>& the Humanities (SVT)   <br>University of Bergen (UiB), Norway   ABSTRACT The effort to provide <br>advice for the Covid-19 pandemics taught us that there is no privileged <br>relevant expertise or techno-scientific silver bullet. Covid-19 has shown that <br>Science does not speak with one and undisputed voice. It also illustrated that <br>the range of disciplines that were consulted was mostly limited to a biomedical <br>elite, along with modelers and economists. It thus revealed that the framing of <br>policy issues is still anchored on the Modern State model of legitimation in <br>which complexity is ignored, and facts are treated as independent of values and <br>of what is at stake. Post-Normal Science (PNS) emerged as a problem-solving strategy <br>that is appropriate when facts are uncertain, values are in conflict, stakes <br>high and decisions urgent. Under those conditions the ideal of Truth gives way <br>to Quality. In PNS, quality is understood as fitness for purpose. It is <br>operationalized through a dialogue between the experts and the extended peer <br>communities. We have still to learn that useful knowledge does not speak only <br>in the language of science. It requires instead a transdisciplinary effort <br>where a plurality of styles of personal 'knowing-how' from experience <br>complement the disciplined 'knowing-that' from textbooks.  </p>  <p> The Covid pandemic is part <br>of several challenges facing humanity today, such as the collapse of ecosystems, <br>the loss of biodiversity and, in general, sustainability transitions. These all <br>share the PNS conditions in the context of persistent extreme inequalities, <br>weak democratic institutions, growing authoritarian temptations, and fantasies <br>of techno-scientific silver bullets. To give effective support to decision-making <br>and political action, Science must not continue to pursue the unattainable <br>goals of precise prediction and total control but should rather participate in a <br>collective effort for the creation of just, responsible and anticipatory <br>knowledge. </p>  <p>   <br>Online seminar Date: April 22 Time: 11 a.m. ENLACE CONEXIÓN TEAMS</p>
