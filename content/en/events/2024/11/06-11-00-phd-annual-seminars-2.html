        <p>In pursuit to enhance the conversation on how social movements contribute to the transformation towards post-/degrowth societies, this doctoral study aims to bring forth lessons from a militant ethnography (Juris, 2007) situated in an anti-capitalist and student climate movement. The combination of disruptive protests through occupations at schools and universities in order to contest the growth economy allows for new perspectives for degrowth where so far disruptive and/or combative grassroots movements have been neglected and instead policy proposals or non-disruptive activism has been favoured. This is matched with a focus on the prefigurative elements of the movement. Where usually decision-making structures are common examples, here the study will draw out various tactics from the groups focusing on de-hierarchisation and anti-oppression politics and praxis; and how this relates to degrowth, adding to the conversation how “decolonising the imaginary’ (Latouche, 2010) can become a more material struggle in degrowth. The doctoral study aims to contribute with its methodology, as well as its empirical work. </p>
