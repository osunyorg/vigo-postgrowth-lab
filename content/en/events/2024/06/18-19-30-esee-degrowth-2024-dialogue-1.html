    ESEE-Degrowth 2024 - Dialogue 1: STS in the context of degrowth: science and technology in the era of colonial capitalist expansion Tuesday 18 June 2024, 17.30h (Pazo da Cultura) with Samer Abdelnour (The Univesity of Edimburg) & Annapurna Mamidipudi (Technical University of Berlin), moderated by Tess Doezema (Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona)
  summary: >-
    <p>  What critical approaches to innovation can we mobilize to think with and for degrowth? Putting in conversation critiques from disparate sites that are not typically centered in conversations on innovation-the first being crafts and handloom weaving, and the second armed conflicts, militaries and war-we ask how we might look outside of our habits of thought and habits of theory to critique technoscience and its entanglements with the extant socioeconomic order.  </p>

  <p>  What critical approaches to innovation can we mobilize to think with and for degrowth? Putting in conversation critiques from disparate sites that are not typically centered in conversations on innovation-the first being crafts and handloom weaving, and the second armed conflicts, militaries and war-we ask how we might look outside of our habits of thought and habits of theory to critique technoscience and its entanglements with the extant socioeconomic order.  </p>
