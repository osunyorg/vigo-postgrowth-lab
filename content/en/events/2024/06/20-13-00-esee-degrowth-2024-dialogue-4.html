    ESEE-Degrowth 2024 - Dialogue 4: What Circular Economy? Thursday 20 June 2024, 11.00h (Plenary tent) with Kersty Hobson (University of Cardiff) & Hans-Christian Eberl (European Comission, responsible for Circular Economy in Horizon Europe), moderated by Andrea Genovese (Sheffield University Management School)
  summary: >-
    <p>  The dialogue will focus on the recent Circular Economy initiatives proposed by the European Union, highlighting current limitations and potential improvements. Panelists will also discuss the emerging tensions between the Circular Economy paradigm and the economic growth imperative, along with policy implications. The need to go beyond simple recycling targets and implementing transformative, but feasible, production and consumption models will also be analysed.  </p>
