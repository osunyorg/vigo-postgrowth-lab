    <p>  <br> Mércores 10: 10:30 a 13:30  Sebastián Iturriaga Gazol  <br>  <br> Title:  </p>  <p> Navigating between appropriating and appropriate technology: the peasant struggle for autonomy in Mexico  <br>  <br>  <br> Abstract:   Given the well-established overlapping crisis confronting agricultural production today, where the dreadful modernist treadmill of agricultural technological (AgTech) systems erodes the biophysical conditions of production. Rehabilitating the old debate between alternative modernity  vis a vis  alternative to modernity in context such as the rural Mexico appears to be more pressing than ever. This debate is rehabilitated by drawing a correspondence to the distinct intellectual and historical lineages of appropriating vs appropriate AgTech in Latin America. This examination is place within the cultural control theory, overarching in the struggle for autonomy following the Mexican rural ethnographical and historical tradition. Empirically, there is then the design for a comparative case study between a collectivization of an irrigation system and a technological peasant experimental network. Conceptually, the comparation is envisioned to be grounded in what has been called ontological design. Furthermore, methodologically there a rudimentary sketch of technographical plan for the field work. The pressing concerns regarding this research are: The somewhat dichotomic blocks (appropriating/ appropriate) which conceptually obscures systemic hybridization, and sustaining a sound comparative framework which account for all the concrete difference (e.g one is an irrigation system the other is not). Looking forward for suggestions addressing these concerns, of course as any other that is not mentioned.    <br> Ana Alfaya Seguín Víctor José Sánchez Suárez  <br>  <br> Title:  In the names of Justice: Problematizing Just Transition scholarship  <br>  <br>  <br> Abstract:  The concept of a"Just Transition" has become a dominant policy framework for reconciling the need for undertake transitions towards sustainability and social justice. However, this presentation argues that the very term "justice" within the scholarship is often under-theorized, ambiguous, and politically co-opted. Moving beyond a celebratory adoption of the term, we problematize the Just Transition discourse by evaluating the assumptions characterizing the most influential literature. We analyze how the plural and often contradictory meanings of justice are conflated or selectively applied, potentially reinforcing existing power structures rather than dismantling them. By critically examining the scholarly  literature, this presentation aims to sharpen the concept's analytical edge and highlight the risks of a "just transition" that fails to name and challenge the root causes of injustice it purports to solve.Ultimately, this presentation calls for a more politically literate and precise scholarship. By forcing a confrontation with the question, "In whose name is justice being invoked?", we aim to reclaim the radical potential of the Just Transition.  <br> Lugar das presentacións: Auditorio del edificio de Benito Corbal (Sótano 1)</p>
