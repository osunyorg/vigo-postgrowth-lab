    <p>  <br> Mércores 10: 10:30 a 13:30  Sebastián Iturriaga Gazol  <br> Title:  Navigating between appropriating and appropriate technology :  the pesant struggle for autonomy in Mexico  <br> Ana Alfaya Seguín Víctor José Sánchez Suárez  <br>  <br> Title:  In the names of Justice: Problematizing Just Transition scholarship  <br>  <br>  <br> Abstract:  The concept of a"Just Transition" has become a dominant policy framework for reconciling the need for undertake transitions towards sustainability and social justice. However, this presentation argues that the very term "justice" within the scholarship is often under-theorized, ambiguous, and politically co-opted. Moving beyond a celebratory adoption of the term, we problematize the Just Transition discourse by evaluating the assumptions characterizing the most influential literature. We analyze how the plural and often contradictory meanings of justice are conflated or selectively applied, potentially reinforcing existing power structures rather than dismantling them. By critically examining the scholarly  literature, this presentation aims to sharpen the concept's analytical edge and highlight the risks of a "just transition" that fails to name and challenge the root causes of injustice it purports to solve.Ultimately, this presentation calls for a more politically literate and precise scholarship. By forcing a confrontation with the question, "In whose name is justice being invoked?", we aim to reclaim the radical potential of the Just Transition.  <br>  <br> Xoves 11 : 16:00 a 18:00 Aitor Alonso Rodríguez  <br>  <br> Title:  Power out front: The role of power in the Sustainability Transition.  <br>  <br>  <br> Abstract:  Sustainability Transition Research (STR) has been paying increasing attention to power as an important concept to understand the social dynamics underlying transitions. At the same time, the sustainable transition is being seeing as a good opportunity to democratize our governance through public participation. However, STR lacks an operational, mechanism-focused account of how different forms of public participation interact with cultural-institutional hegemony to transform or reproduce power relations and thereby shape transition pathways. To answer, the thesis studies the interaction between power and public participation through a historical analysis of Ence. The goal is to see how different grassroots initiatives interacted with incumbent actors to position the company where is today. In addition, an empirical case study - CoBlue project - analyse how an institutionally embedded public participation process may mobilized expectations, thus impacting in agency and the relations of power.The dissertation contributes to the literature by deepening our understanding of power and public participation in STR. Furthermore, the thesis contributes to policymaking by advancing knowledge on the role of public participation in sustainability transitions, thus enabling clear explanations for policymakers to understand which participation designs are desirable for which problems and how to structure them.  <br> Ana García Quintana Lugar das presentacións: Auditorio del edificio de Benito Corbal (Sótano 1)</p>
