    Seminar - Emily Cunniffe (Trinity College, Dublin) "There just can't be green without blue": The just transition in Europe's fisheries and the role of labour law
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>  Labour and nature are deeply intertwined in the fishing sector. Yet, legislation for environmental protection and legislation for labour protection remain disconnected and, moreover, limited in their effectiveness for achieving sustainability. This seminar examines the concept of a just transition in fishing from a labour law perspective. It explores the existing labour protections for fishers and considers how these frameworks might be used to advance social sustainability as part of a broader understanding of sustainability. Historically, labour law has played a central role in separating labour from nature. This seminar asks whether it might instead serve to recognise and reinforce their entanglement.  </p>
