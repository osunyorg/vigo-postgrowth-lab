Yet, legislation for environmental protection and legislation for labour protection remain disconnected and, moreover, limited in their effectiveness for achieving sustainability. This seminar examines the concept of a just transition in fishing from a labour law perspective. It explores the existing labour protections for fishers and considers how these frameworks might be used to advance social sustainability as part of a broader understanding of sustainability. Historically, labour law has played a central role in separating labour from nature. This seminar asks whether it might instead serve to recognise and reinforce their entanglement.  </p>
