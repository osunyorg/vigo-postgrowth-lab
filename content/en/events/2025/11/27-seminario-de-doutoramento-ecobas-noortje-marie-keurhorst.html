      <p>More info: ECOBAS <br>https://ecobas.gal/events/seminario-de-doutoramento-josephine-becker-investigadora-predoutoral-da-uvigo-909/</p>  <p>   <br>Abstract: Galicia is a region in the Northwest of Spain currently credited as producing more than half of the country's timber, with further industrial growth expected as the bioeconomy gains legitimacy. However, the future of the  monte  (the Galician landscape) is contested, with differing visions and practices emerging across a range of actors. This PhD project examines how the  monte  is imagined as a site for desirable futures by engaging with three distinct groups (activists, local communities, and state forestry), using an interactional co-productionist approach and the framework of sociotechnical imaginaries. The aim of this thesis is to better understand how competing ideas about the  monte  circulate, gain traction, and are negotiated to both loosen up current debates about the future of the Galician  monte  and engage constructively with work in political ecology concerning forestry.Theoretically, the thesis draws on interactional co-production to explore how certain actions and practices in the  monte  materialize while others do not. The sociotechnical imaginaries framework introduces a normative dimension to this analysis, offering insight into why visions of the future are stabilized or contested. The study expands this framework by engaging with vanguard visions from marginal actors, highlighting the multiplicity of knowledge claims and competing imaginaries shaping the Galician  monte .Methodologically, the research is grounded in ethnographic fieldwork. I engage with  comunidades de montes vecinales en man común , which govern around 25% of Galician territory as common lands. Field visits and in-depth qualitative research were carried out in the communities of Mourente (Pontevedra), Froxán (A Coruña), and Lentille (Ourense). In parallel, I engaged with a group of anti-eucalyptus activists called the Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras, with whom I undertook 12 actions in different places in Galicia to understand how a seemingly unique practice of destroying trees on a voluntary basis arises to bring about a desirable future. Complementing these participatory engagements, I conducted a literature review of work in the realm of forestry science to trace how the  monte  has historically been imagined as a source of national prosperity and how such imaginaries have shaped its material transformation over time. These historical transformations are further engaged with through interviews and documents that shed light on how community actors resisted and interacted with institutional imaginaries to enact their particular visions of the  monte .This thesis contributes to political ecology literature by analyzing how knowledge is mobilized and negotiated across diverse actors and institutional sites to legitimize particular visions of the  monte . It responds to calls for greater attention to historical contingency in environmental governance, challenging the totalizing tendencies of the theoretical lens of neoliberal natures. By extending the sociotechnical imaginaries framework to the field of forestry, an area rarely studied through this lens, and focusing on a Global North context, the research broadens current understandings of how forests function as arenas of political, epistemic, and ecological contestation.  </p>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b></p><p>Galicia is a region in the Northwest of Spain currently credited as producing more than half of the country's timber, with further industrial growth expected as the bioeconomy gains legitimacy. However, the future of the <i>monte </i>(the Galician landscape) is contested, with differing visions and practices emerging across a range of actors. This PhD project examines how the <i>monte </i>is imagined as a site for desirable futures by engaging with three distinct groups (activists, local communities, and state forestry), using an interactional co-productionist approach and the framework of sociotechnical imaginaries. The aim of this thesis is to better understand how competing ideas about the <i>monte </i>circulate, gain traction, and are negotiated to both loosen up current debates about the future of the Galician <i>monte </i>and engage constructively with work in political ecology concerning forestry.Theoretically, the thesis draws on interactional co-production to explore how certain actions and practices in the <i>monte </i>materialize while others do not. The sociotechnical imaginaries framework introduces a normative dimension to this analysis, offering insight into why visions of the future are stabilized or contested. The study expands this framework by engaging with vanguard visions from marginal actors, highlighting the multiplicity of knowledge claims and competing imaginaries shaping the Galician <i>monte</i>.Methodologically, the research is grounded in ethnographic fieldwork.
