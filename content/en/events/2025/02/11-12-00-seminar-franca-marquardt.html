      <p>Link on Youtube <br>https://youtu.be/_IjZD9wDq94?si=rDjFvAYJiKjZXt9H</p>  <p>   <br>The PhD project explores emotions and affective bonds within <br>internationalist and eco-feminist movements and to what extent this relates to <br>a new form of intersectional, prefigurative practice of movement-building. As <br>such, it interrogates how we can move from an isolated narrative of identities <br>towards a political struggle, taking into account the complexities of <br>interlocking systems of oppression. Internationalist and <br>eco-feminist movements spearhead intersectional thinking as they centre <br>revolutionary love, a more-than-romantic feeling of <br>relation based on a common vision for liberation. This ‘affective <br>internationalism’ is based on collective healing and feeling each other’s pain <br>in a way that considers hierarchies of solidarity and emotional communication <br>with non-human ecosystems. In this context, the thesis advocates for a deeper <br>understanding of the interconnected emotions of love and anger as <br>transformative tools against systemic violence and capitalist alienation. <br>Through long-term ethnographic fieldwork and participatory methods, the <br>project looks at the possibilities and challenges of building affective bonds <br>within and across movements. Here, emotions between activists and their <br>networks build the groundwork for exploring the larger process of building a <br>movement for liberation from imperialist capitalism.  <br>About Franca Marquardt: https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/people/franca-marquardt/</p>
