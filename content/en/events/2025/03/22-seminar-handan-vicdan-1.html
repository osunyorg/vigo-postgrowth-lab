      <p>Online broadcasting</p>  <p>   <br> "As a scholar with 15 years of experience in critical marketing and consumer research, I seek to engage in a reflexive dialogue on the transformative potential of post-growth scholarship in business academia. Drawing on my research on ecological living and organizing, participatory market systems that integrate human and more-than-human actors (e.g., technology, nature, waste), and alternative business practices conducive to a degrowth transition (e.g., circular practices), I will highlight key contributions to post-growth research. This presentation serves as a parrhesiastic intervention for catalyzing discussions on post-growth scholarship and pedagogy in business academia, and as a call for future research collaborations to advance interdisciplinary post-growth research".   <br>Handan Vicdan is an Associate Professor of Critical Marketing and Consumer Research at Emlyon Business School. Her research focuses on the ideological, technological, and sociocultural issues surrounding consumption and production, with particular interest in degrowth/postgrowth consumer/business culture, sustainable living, alternative forms of consumption and production, and human-technology power relations. Her research has been published in Marketing Theory, Journal of Macromarketing, Journal of Business Research, M@n@gement, Consumption, Markets & Culture, Journal of Marketing Management, and Journal of Consumer Culture, and in books such as The Routledge Handbook of Digital Consumption and Digital Virtual Consumption. </p>
