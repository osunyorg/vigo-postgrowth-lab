I take up key thinkers such as Yoshirou Tamanoi, Kazuko Tsurumi, and Takashi Uchiyama, highlighting their intellectual developments leading to a place-based relational ontology. In particular, my talk examines the ways in which their place-based thinking spatializes/pluralizes technology and economy through the notions of living system, animism, mandala, and multi-layered community. I discuss how postdevelopment in Japan deepens a culturalist notion of limits, hence reframing key categories in degrowth and contributing to a design for the pluriverse. <br>Yoshihiro <br>Nakano is a specially-appointed associate professor at the Graduate School of <br>Social Design Studies at Rikkyo University, Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Nakano is a <br>specialist in social theory and critical development studies, teaching various <br>courses in the fields of development and peace studies, social innovation, and <br>the Anthropocene studies. Dr. Nakano is also an instigator of degrowth in Japan <br>and translated a number of books on degrowth and post-development (mainly Serge <br>Latouche and other French and Italian authors) into Japanese.

        <p>This seminar introduces a current of postdevelopment thinking in Japan and discusses its contribution to the global debate on degrowth and the pluriverse. I take up key thinkers such as Yoshirou Tamanoi, Kazuko Tsurumi, and Takashi Uchiyama, highlighting their intellectual developments leading to a place-based relational ontology. In particular, my talk examines the ways in which their place-based thinking spatializes/pluralizes technology and economy through the notions of living system, animism, mandala, and multi-layered community. I discuss how postdevelopment in Japan deepens a culturalist notion of limits, hence reframing key categories in degrowth and contributing to a design for the pluriverse.</p>
