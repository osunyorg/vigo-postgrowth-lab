        <p>This seminar introduces a current of postdevelopment thinking in Japan and discusses its contribution to the global debate on degrowth and the pluriverse. I take up key thinkers such as Yoshirou Tamanoi, Kazuko Tsurumi, and Takashi Uchiyama, highlighting their intellectual developments leading to a place-based relational ontology. In particular, my talk examines the ways in which their place-based thinking spatializes/pluralizes technology and economy through the notions of living system, animism, mandala, and multi-layered community. I discuss how postdevelopment in Japan deepens a culturalist notion of limits, hence reframing key categories in degrowth and contributing to a design for the pluriverse.</p>
