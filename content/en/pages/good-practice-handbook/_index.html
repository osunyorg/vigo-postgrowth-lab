    <p>  <br>The purpose of <br>this manual is to  improve group communication and the working dynamics  and to serve as a reference for the resolution of doubts related to procedures <br>and formalities that are carried out in a more or less habitual manner.  </p>  <p> It is a  living <br>document , which can and should be modified and improved whenever necessary, and <br>is open to suggestions that the group members may have at any time.</p>  <p> WORKING DYNAMICS  <br> Spaces and schedule  <br>The group's main <br>office is located at calle  Benito Corbal 45, 5th floor .  The Benito <br>Corbal office has a "fishbowl", a closed room that can and should be <br>used for face-to-face or virtual meetings, avoiding whenever possible to hold <br>this type of meeting in the open area so as not to disturb the staff at work. <br>Bookings will be made through a shared calendar which can be accessed from  this link .  In addition, the <br>following spaces are also available:  <br> School of Economics and Business Administration  (Campus Lagoas-Marcosende, Vigo): offices 309 and <br>144. To use these spaces, please contact Cristina Vázquez in advance. ( crisvsantos@uvigo.gal ). <br> </p>  <p>  <br> Business School in Vigo  (Torrecedeira <br>St., building next to Peritos): There is a large room, number A313, where <br>Carlos Iglesias (Calu) has his office, but additional tables are available for <br>anyone who needs to use them. When they are to be used, it is advisable, <br>however, to contact Calu beforehand to inform him ( calu@uvigo.gal ).  Although <br>teleworking is not officially regulated at the University of Vigo, the group's <br>policy is that those who wish to telework may do so. However, it is recommended <br>that at least those who are contracted under the group's projects,  attend <br>at least two days a week in person at the office  at Benito Corbal 45, <br>preferably in the mornings. Group members should also attend in person when <br>there are scheduled activities such as seminars, conferences, or workshops, <br>unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent them from doing so, <br>such as being traveling, on leave, or due to work-related reasons.  </p>  <p> Working <br>hours are flexible, and it is the responsibility of each person to comply with <br>the hours stipulated in their contract. However, to facilitate the dynamics of <br>the group, it is recommended that,  whenever possible, part of the working <br>day should take place between 10.00 and 13.00 , both in person and remotely. <br>In this way, there will always be a time slot in which to schedule activities <br>or to contact other group members without invading their private lives.</p>  <p> Non-working days  <br>During the year <br>2026 the public holidays will be as follows:   <br>  <br> 1 January : New Year's Day  <br>  <br> 6 January : Epiphany  <br>  <br> 26 <br>January : St. Thomas Aquinas, patron saint of the University (non-working day)  <br>  <br> 18 February : Carnival (in Pontevedra)  <br>  <br> 19 March : Saint Joseph   <br>  <br> 28 March : Vigo Reconquest (in Vigo)  <br>  <br> 2-3 April : Easter holidays  <br>  <br> 1 May : Labour Day  <br>  <br> 24 June : Saint John  <br>  <br> 11 July : Saint Benedict (in Pontevedra)  <br>  <br> 25 July : Santiago Apostle   <br>  <br> 15 August : Assumption of the Virgin Mary  <br>  <br> 17 <br>August : Saint Roque (in Vigo)  <br>  <br> 12 October : Spain's national holiday  <br>  <br> 8 December:  Immaculate Conception Day  <br>  <br> 25 December : Christmas Day  <br> </p>  <p>University of Vigo academic <br>calendar can be consulted at the  following link .</p>  <p> Holidays & Days off   <br>In general, the <br>staff of the group contracted for R&D&i projects is governed by the  PDI labour agreement  regarding days <br>off and holidays, which states that each person will be entitled to:  <br> 22 <br>working days of holiday per year  <br> 9 <br>working days for private affairs  <br> In addition, <br>there will be the possibility of taking leave days for reasons of reconciling <br>personal, family, and work life in exceptional circumstances such as marriage, <br>illness of a direct relative, moving house, maternity/paternity... To find out <br>how many days correspond to these circumstances, you should check article 37 of <br>the aforementioned agreement and, if in doubt, contact the PDI office. In order to <br>improve working dynamics and to avoid being contacted by other members of the <br>group during our days off, it is necessary to inform about the days off and <br>holidays to be taken. To do this, the <br>following should be done:   <br> Send the  holiday request form  or the  private affairs request form  signed by the <br>applicant and the person in charge to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal . This should be done as far in advance as <br>possible.  <br> Indicate in the  shared calendar  the days of <br>holidays/private affairs to be taken, so that the rest of the people in the <br>group can be aware of our absence. Please also use this calendar to indicate other days when you are less available than usual, e.g. if you are ill, travelling or taking part in a course or other event. </p>  <p>Useful contacts: PDI service:  negociadopdi04@uvigo.gal , 986813765</p>  <p> Travel & Events Attendance  <br>Whenever a trip <br>is to be made that involves leaving the usual place of residence, unless it <br>takes place during holiday periods or days off, the person in charge (PI of the <br>project under which the group member is contracted) and the management team <br>must be informed. This rule is not intended to control the group's personnel, <br>but rather to ensure safety and improve work dynamics.  As indicated in <br>the previous section, teleworking is not regulated at the University of Vigo <br>and, therefore, all the people who work in this entity only enjoy coverage <br>against possible contingencies that may occur during the working day while they <br>are in the facilities of their work centre and during the journey between their <br>home and the centre (before and after the end of the working day). If during a <br>trip that we have not notified to the person in charge some kind of accident <br>occurs, we may encounter a problem when carrying out certain procedures, such <br>as requesting a sick leave due to an accident at work or  in itinere , <br>since the mutual insurance company may not cover our salary during the time we <br>are unable to work because the accident took place in a different city from the <br>one in which our workplace is located. In addition, the notification of our <br>trips and journeys will also facilitate the dynamics of the group, for example, <br>when choosing the date for an activity, so that it can take place when most of the <br>group members are able to attend. On the other <br>hand, in order to keep a better record of the activities carried out by each <br>person in the group, an  Excel spreadsheet  has been set up <br>to record information on attendance and participation in scientific, dissemination <br>and other types of events carried out in the context of the work activity. </p>  <p>This information is <br>necessary for the preparation of the group's annual reports, and the <br>contribution of each member greatly facilitates the collection of this <br>information for the preparation of these reports.</p>  <p> FINANCIAL PROCEDURES  <br>   <br>If you have a <br>financial need, you must first inform your person in charge. Once that person <br>has authorised the expenditure, the procedures will be initiated. As a rule, <br>invoices should always be requested in the name of the University of Vigo.:  School of Economics and Business <br>Administration Campus Lagoas-Marcosende s/n, Universidade de Vigo 36310 Vigo (Pontevedra) VAT: <br>ES-Q8650002B </p>  <p> The following are the steps to follow for the most common economic procedures. If your need is not <br>among the options in this list, please contact the management team and provide <br>them with the details.</p>  <p> Registration for events and courses  <br>Whenever <br>possible, the option of payment by bank transfer should be chosen, and this payment <br>shall be made directly from the university. 1 - Send <br>an email to the management team, indicating:  <br> Link to event registration page  <br> Link to the section of the site where the registration fees and payment details are indicated (or document containing this information)  <br>  <br> 2 - Once <br>this information has been received, the management team will give you the instructions  for registration and payment and will confirm whether payment will be made directly form the UVigo or if exceptionally it should <br>be made by you.</p>  <p> Travels  <br>As a rule, bookings <br>must be made and paid by the university.  1 - Send <br>an email will to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal  indicating the travel <br>details (location and date of departure and return, reason for the trip, <br>preferred means of transport, preferred type of accommodation).  2 - This <br>information will be provided to the travel agency , copying the <br>interested person so that she/he can evaluate and select the preferred options <br>from among those offered by the agency. The interested person will also be put <br>in contact with the Area of Support to Research and Transfer Management <br>(UAITAXSH -  uaitaxsh@uvigo.es ), who will <br>be in charge of placing the orders. When replying to e-mails received during <br>this process, all the persons listed in the copy should be kept in order to <br>facilitate communication and avoid intermediate steps that can slow down the <br>process.  3 - After <br>each travel , it will be necessary to send as soon as possible to UAITAXSH (with a <br>copy to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal ) <br>the boarding passes, train and/or bus tickets, and the certificate of <br>attendance or a similar document proving that the trip has taken place (for <br>example: if we have made a research stay or attended a meeting, an e-mail from <br>the entity visited confirming that we have been there would be useful). </p>  <p> 4 - In <br>exceptional cases,  it may be possible to book the travel directly and <br>subsequently request a refund, but this should always be the last option and <br>must be requested in advance, due to the administrative complications involved <br>in this type of procedure, which is often not possible or makes reimbursement <br>extremely difficult. There is the <br>possibility of receiving  daily subsistence allowances  during our <br>travels, but this should be discussed directly with the person in charge, who <br>will have to approve them and tell you how many days of subsistence you could <br>receive. The purpose of these payments is to cover additional expenses that we <br>may have during our travel, so, logically, no subsistence allowances will be <br>paid for meals that are already paid for in another way (for example, if we <br>attend an event where meals are included in the registration fee, we could <br>request payment for dinners, but never for lunches).  </p>  <p> Reimbursement <br>may also be requested for  additional transport costs  incurred during the <br>trip, such as city transport passes or taxis. This should be requested upon <br>return from the trip, by emailing a copy of the tickets for these expenses to the <br>management team. In the message, in addition to attaching the copy of the <br>tickets, the total amount of the reimbursement requested shall be indicated.</p>  <p> Office supplies  <br>Office supplies <br>must be purchased through a specific company, DISMAC, which is the official <br>supplier of the University of Vigo. If you need any office supplies, send an e-mail to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal  indicating the specific type of <br>material required (including brand and model, when a very specific product is <br>required). </p>  <p> IT Equipment  <br>1 - Send an e-mail <br>to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal  indicating the equipment <br>needed. Specify the model or the chacacteristics required. If any option for <br>the acquisition of the device has already been sought, please indicate the <br>company supplying the equipment. Otherwise, the management team will put you in <br>contact with any of the UVigo suppliers. 2 - If the request <br>is approved  by the group director or the person in charge, the purchase procedure <br>will begin. 3 - Whenever <br>possible, reconditioned material will be purchased . </p>  <p> 4 - Once the device <br>has been received , please send a copy of the dispatch note and a photo of the device to  management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal .</p>  <p> COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION  <br> Corporate Identity  <br>You can download the group  corporate identity guidelines   here . As far as possible, all group members shall follow these <br>indications, using the corporate fonts and colours in the elaboration of <br>documents, posters, web pages...  </p>  <p>  <br> Corporate fonts: <br> Merriweather  (only for titles) and  Raleway  (the main one). <br>Please, go to the "Downloads" section of this manual, download them and install them on your computer.  <br>  <br> Logos: You will find the logos of the group in the "Downloads" section. Please follow the corporate identity guidelines to avoid misuse of these logos. </p>  <p> E-mail signatures  <br>The following structure and format shall be used in <br>the signature of e-mails: HTML FORMAT (with images):  Raleway font In  this picture  you can see an example of the recommended structure. Go to the " Downloads " section to download the group logos and an example of signature in HTML format.

Some examples of information that can be published are:  <br> Publication <br>of a new paper  <br> Participation <br>in an event to present a paper  <br> Organisation of an activity  <br> Obtaining an award  <br> Obtaining funding for a project  <br> Carrying <br>out a research stay  <br> …  <br>  <br> Whenever possible, in addition to the information we <br>want to be published, we will also provide her with pictures or photos.  </p>  <p>As far as possible, those <br>who have social networks should try to share and/or comment on the group's posts <br>to give them visibility. It is also advisable to keep our social network <br>accounts active (some studies indicate that publications published on networks <br>such as X, formerly Twitter, have up to 50% more citations). <br>Useful contacts and links: Carmen <br>Rey:  communication.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal Social <br>media profiles:  <br>  <br> https://twitter.com/post_growth    <br>  <br> https://www.linkedin.com/company/postgrowth-lab    <br>  <br> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCao5M0Or1psRVfe-ulehn_w    <br>  <br> https://www.linkedin.com/company/esee-degrowth2024/    <br>  <br> https://twitter.com/ESEE_Degrowth    <br> </p>  <p> https://www.instagram.com/esee_degrowth/  <br> </p>  <p> Scientific publications signature  <br>When publishing a scientific paper, we must indicate <br>our affiliation following the guidelines of the University of Vigo, which can <br>be consulted in  this <br>link  (Spanish version) or  this <br>one  (English version). </p>  <p> Generic example of how to sign an article: Jane <br>Doe Universidade de Vigo, <br>Post-Growth Innovation Lab, 36001, Pontevedra, España  <br> If <br>you belong to a research centre, in addition to the group: Jane <br>Doe ECOBAS, Universidade de <br>Vigo, Post-Growth Innovation Lab, 36001, Pontevedra, España  <br> It is important <br>to keep your professional profiles updated. Periodically check your data both <br>in the  University of Vigoresearch portal  and in other external platforms such as  ORCID  or  SCOPUS , <br>and make sure that your affiliation is correct.</p>  <p> OTHER ISSUES  <br> Access to scientific databases  <br>To access scientific databases such as Scopus or Web <br>of Science and many of the online editorials, if you are not using the UVigo network <br>you must connect using the UVigo proxy. To do this, configure and activate the proxy <br>connection of your computer using this data:  <br> IP proxy <br>address:  http://proxy.uvigo.es  <br>  <br> Port: 3333  <br> It is also recommended to install the " Unpaywall " application in your browser, which is very useful as it allows you to find out if an article is published in an open repository. </p>  <p> Data management  <br>When conducting research work it is necessary to <br>follow the data management protocol of the project we are working on. This <br>includes issues of ethical standards, data collection and storage... More <br>information on these issues can be found in  this presentation . </p>  <p> Residence permit renewal  <br>You <br>can download  here  a guide on how to renew your residence permit (non-EU <br>citizens).</p>  <p> RECURRENT CALLS  <br> UNIVERSITY OF VIGO'S OWN GRANTS TO GROUPS, RESEARCH CENTRES AND CLUSTERS (Axudas propias a grupos, centros de investigación e agrupacións da Universidade de Vigo)  <br>It is  usually open around May  (for a few weeks, less than a month). There are several modalities within this call. The most relevant ones for you would be: Modality A.2. <br>Preparation of international projects  (Preparación <br>de proxectos internacionais) </p>  <p>  <br> These grants allow the co-financing of costs related to the preparation <br>of project proposals for Horizon Europe or other European calls or <br>participation in information days and specific partner search events. Expenses <br>related to the preparation of proposals for one of the ERC calls (Starting, <br>Consolidator or Advanced Grants) are also eligible, provided that the <br>researcher commits to submit the proposal within a maximum period of 1 year <br>after receiving the grant.  <br> They would be used to cover expenses such as technical support from <br>specialised consultancies, travel to info days, translations, etc.  <br> The maximum grant that can be awarded is €5,000 (if you go as <br>coordinator of the proposal or submit a proposal to an ERC); or €3,000 if you <br>participate as a partner in the consortium..  <br> </p>  <p> Modality B.1.  Organisation of <br>scientific congresses or meetings  ( Organización de congresos o reuniones <br>científicas ) </p>  <p>  <br> They cannot be used for the organisation of courses or lecture series; they must be congresses or scientific conferences.  <br> Only one application per group is permitted.  <br> You can apply the year before the event and choose whether you would like to receive the funding in the year of application or in the year of the event. Example: If you are organising a conference in 2026, you can apply in 2025 and ask for the funding to be released in 2025 (for expenses that need to be incurred in that year, such as creating the conference website) or for it to be released in 2026.  <br> The eligible expenses are very diverse. For example, technical support from an external body that is involved in the organisation, cover the costs of creating the event's corporate identity, pay for travel expenses for guest speakers...  <br> The grant is higher if the event is international. The maximum grant that can be awarded is €3,000.  <br> </p>  <p> Modality B.3. Visit of research staff from other centres  ( Visita de <br>personal investigador de otros centros ) </p>  <p>  <br> To cover the travelling and accommodation costs of persons visiting the group. A grant may be requested for the simultaneous participation of more than one person if this takes place in the context of a working meeting, workshop, joint seminar, etc.  <br> Only one grant will be awarded per research group.  <br> The visit must necessarily include an activity such as a lecture, seminar or workshop.  <br> The maximum grant is €1,000 and the amount depends on where the invited person(s) is travelling from. </p>  <p>Link to the 2024 call:  https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/uv/web/convocatoria/public/show/1336  </p>  <p> GRANTS FOR THE MOBILITY OF UVIGO'S RESEARCH PERSONNEL (Axudas propias para a mobilidade de Persoal Investigador da UVigo)  <br>Great interest for PhD researchers! The aim is to co-finance  trips to present research results at scientific events or to carry out research visits  to other centres outside Galicia.. It is  usually open in spring  (March-April). There are two  modalities : Modality A. Travel grants  ( Bolsas para viajes )  <br> To partially finance travel for the presentation of communications at national or international scientific congresses or conferences.  <br> The amount of the grant depends on the destination. The maximum amount is € 1,050 for Asia and Oceania.  <br> Modality B. Grants for stays at research centres  ( Bolsas para estancias en centros de investigación )  <br> To finance stays in research centres outside Galicia.  <br> The stay must take place in a single period and in a single centre and last between 30 and 90 days.  <br> The amount of the grant depends on the destination and the duration of the stay, with a maximum of €3,000.  <br> A person can apply for a grant for each modality, but the amount they receive for both modalities together never exceeds €3,000. There are two  types of applicants : Group 1: PhD researchers  Those who have received a scholarship from the Xunta, the Ministry, of Uvigo... cannot apply for this grant for the same stay for which they have received a scholarship from these organisations. Group 2:  Research staff recruited as part of a competitive programme for predoctoral research staff in training and who are in the postdoctoral orientation phase (POP). <br>Link to the 2024 call:  https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/uv/web/convocatoria/public/show/1323</p>  <p> XUNTA DE GALICIA PhD SCHOLARSHIPS(Axudas de apoio á etapa predoutoral da Xunta de Galicia)  <br>The call for applications  usually starts at the beginning of the year  (January-February).

The stay must be continuous and last between 20 and 24 months.  <br> The following  criteria are taken into account when evaluating applications for Phase 1 : - Scientific publications (maximum 40 points). Books with ISBNs and articles receive more points than book chapters. The articles that receive more points are published in journals indexed in SCI, SSCI or AHCI. - Participation in research projects or research contracts with companies, administrations and others (maximum 20 points). European or international projects receive the highest score. - Patents (maximum 10 points) - Stays in centres other than the one in which the doctorate was obtained (maximum 5 points).

        <p>The group's main office is located at calle <b>Benito Corbal 45, 5th floor</b>. </p><p>The Benito Corbal office has a "fishbowl", a closed room that can and should be used for face-to-face or virtual meetings, avoiding whenever possible to hold this type of meeting in the open area so as not to disturb the staff at work. Bookings will be made through a shared calendar which can be accessed from <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dmVrdDc2azkwNm1vNnRpMGs0OTRic2VsbW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">this link</a>. </p><p>In addition, the following spaces are also available:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fj6AqdNwha3a3d5q7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>School of Economics and Business Administration</b> <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a><b></b> (Campus Lagoas-Marcosende, Vigo): offices 309 and 144.

However, it is recommended that at least those who are contracted under the group's projects, <b>attend at least two days a week in person at the office</b> at Benito Corbal 45, preferably in the mornings. Group members should also attend in person when there are scheduled activities such as seminars, conferences, or workshops, unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent them from doing so, such as being traveling, on leave, or due to work-related reasons. </p><p>            </p><p>Working hours are flexible, and it is the responsibility of each person to comply with the hours stipulated in their contract. However, to facilitate the dynamics of the group, it is recommended that, <b>whenever possible, part of the working day should take place between 10.00 and 13.00</b>, both in person and remotely. In this way, there will always be a time slot in which to schedule activities or to contact other group members without invading their private lives.</p>

        <p>In general, the staff of the group contracted for R&D&i projects is governed by the <a href="https://www.xunta.gal/dog/Publicados/2011/20110414/Anuncio11926_es.html">PDI labour agreement</a> regarding days off and holidays, which states that each person will be entitled to:</p><ul> <li><b>22 working days of holiday per year</b></li> <li><b>9 working days for private affairs</b></li> </ul><p>In addition, there will be the possibility of taking leave days for reasons of reconciling personal, family, and work life in exceptional circumstances such as marriage, illness of a direct relative, moving house, maternity/paternity... To find out how many days correspond to these circumstances, you should check article 37 of the aforementioned agreement and, if in doubt, contact the PDI office.</p><p>In order to improve working dynamics and to avoid being contacted by other members of the group during our days off, it is necessary to inform about the days off and holidays to be taken. To do this, the following should be done: </p><ol> <li>Send the <a href="https://osuny.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/9kcdm8s1xfhqr1h2bdk5sfv2nvvt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>holiday request form</b> <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> or the <a href="https://osuny.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/016qfg7onokq2rgamscttyd3v0i3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>private affairs request form</b> <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> signed by the applicant and the person in charge to <a href="mailto:management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal">management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal</a>.

        <p>Whenever a trip is to be made that involves leaving the usual place of residence, unless it takes place during holiday periods or days off, the person in charge (PI of the project under which the group member is contracted) and the management team must be informed. This rule is not intended to control the group's personnel, but rather to ensure safety and improve work dynamics. </p><p>As indicated in the previous section, teleworking is not regulated at the University of Vigo and, therefore, all the people who work in this entity only enjoy coverage against possible contingencies that may occur during the working day while they are in the facilities of their work centre and during the journey between their home and the centre (before and after the end of the working day). If during a trip that we have not notified to the person in charge some kind of accident occurs, we may encounter a problem when carrying out certain procedures, such as requesting a sick leave due to an accident at work or <i>in itinere</i>, since the mutual insurance company may not cover our salary during the time we are unable to work because the accident took place in a different city from the one in which our workplace is located. In addition, the notification of our trips and journeys will also facilitate the dynamics of the group, for example, when choosing the date for an activity, so that it can take place when most of the group members are able to attend.</p><p>On the other hand, in order to keep a better record of the activities carried out by each person in the group, an <a href="https://universidadevigo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sonia_pascual_uvigo_gal/Ea6fmUpyiIJKi_bQHpydFIABgswTU7iPY_hqdy7w_LIDvg?e=55ihMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Excel spreadsheet <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> has been set up to record information on attendance and participation in scientific, dissemination and other types of events carried out in the context of the work activity.</p><p>      This information is necessary for the preparation of the group's annual reports, and the contribution of each member greatly facilitates the collection of this information for the preparation of these reports.</p>

        <p>As a rule, bookings must be made and paid by the university. </p><p><b>1 - Send an email will to <a href="mailto:management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal">management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal</a></b> indicating the travel details (location and date of departure and return, reason for the trip, preferred means of transport, preferred type of accommodation). </p><p><b>2 - This information will be provided to the travel agency</b>, copying the interested person so that she/he can evaluate and select the preferred options from among those offered by the agency. The interested person will also be put in contact with the Area of Support to Research and Transfer Management (UAITAXSH - <a href="mailto:uaitaxsh@uvigo.es">uaitaxsh@uvigo.es</a>), who will be in charge of placing the orders. When replying to e-mails received during this process, all the persons listed in the copy should be kept in order to facilitate communication and avoid intermediate steps that can slow down the process. </p><p><b>3 - After each travel</b>, it will be necessary to send as soon as possible to UAITAXSH (with a copy to <a href="mailto:management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal">management.postgrowth-lab@uvigo.gal</a>) the boarding passes, train and/or bus tickets, and the certificate of attendance or a similar document proving that the trip has taken place (for example: if we have made a research stay or attended a meeting, an e-mail from the entity visited confirming that we have been there would be useful).</p><p>        </p><p><b>4 - In exceptional cases,</b> it may be possible to book the travel directly and subsequently request a refund, but this should always be the last option and must be requested in advance, due to the administrative complications involved in this type of procedure, which is often not possible or makes reimbursement extremely difficult.</p><p>There is the possibility of receiving <b>daily subsistence allowances</b> during our travels, but this should be discussed directly with the person in charge, who will have to approve them and tell you how many days of subsistence you could receive. The purpose of these payments is to cover additional expenses that we may have during our travel, so, logically, no subsistence allowances will be paid for meals that are already paid for in another way (for example, if we attend an event where meals are included in the registration fee, we could request payment for dinners, but never for lunches). </p><p>  </p><p>Reimbursement may also be requested for <b>additional transport costs</b> incurred during the trip, such as city transport passes or taxis. This should be requested upon return from the trip, by emailing a copy of the tickets for these expenses to the management team. In the message, in addition to attaching the copy of the tickets, the total amount of the reimbursement requested shall be indicated.</p>

        <p><b>What we do is as important as communicating what we do.</b> The group has a <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> and profiles on different social networks that are used to give visibility to our work. It is therefore important that, when we have any news, we inform the person in charge of communication, who until the end of August will be Carmen Rey. Some examples of information that can be published are:</p><ul> <li>Publication of a new paper</li> <li>Participation in an event to present a paper</li> <li>Organisation of an activity</li> <li>Obtaining an award</li> <li>Obtaining funding for a project</li> <li>Carrying out a research stay</li> <li>…<br> </li> </ul><p>Whenever possible, in addition to the information we want to be published, we will also provide her with pictures or photos. </p><p>                  As far as possible, those who have social networks should try to share and/or comment on the group's posts to give them visibility. It is also advisable to keep our social network accounts active (some studies indicate that publications published on networks such as X, formerly Twitter, have up to 50% more citations).</p>

        <p>To access scientific databases such as Scopus or Web of Science and many of the online editorials, if you are not using the UVigo network you must connect using the UVigo proxy. To do this, configure and activate the proxy connection of your computer using this data:</p><ul> <li>IP proxy address: <a href="http://proxy.uvigo.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://proxy.uvigo.es <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a><a href="http://proxy.uvigo.es/"></a> </li> <li>Port: 3333</li> </ul><p>It is also recommended to install the "<a href="https://unpaywall.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unpaywall <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>" application in your browser, which is very useful as it allows you to find out if an article is published in an open repository.</p><ul> </ul>

        <p>It is <b>usually open around May </b>(for a few weeks, less than a month).</p><p>There are several modalities within this call. The most relevant ones for you would be:</p><p><b>Modality A.2. Preparation of international projects </b>(Preparación de proxectos internacionais)</p><p>  </p><ul> <li>These grants allow the co-financing of costs related to the preparation of project proposals for Horizon Europe or other European calls or participation in information days and specific partner search events. Expenses related to the preparation of proposals for one of the ERC calls (Starting, Consolidator or Advanced Grants) are also eligible, provided that the researcher commits to submit the proposal within a maximum period of 1 year after receiving the grant.</li> <li>They would be used to cover expenses such as technical support from specialised consultancies, travel to info days, translations, etc.</li> <li>The maximum grant that can be awarded is €5,000 (if you go as coordinator of the proposal or submit a proposal to an ERC); or €3,000 if you participate as a partner in the consortium..</li> </ul><p>  </p><p><b>Modality B.1. </b><b>Organisation of scientific congresses or meetings </b>(<i>Organización de congresos o reuniones científicas</i>)</p><p>  </p><ul> <li>They cannot be used for the organisation of courses or lecture series; they must be congresses or scientific conferences.</li> <li>Only one application per group is permitted.</li> <li>You can apply the year before the event and choose whether you would like to receive the funding in the year of application or in the year of the event. Example: If you are organising a conference in 2026, you can apply in 2025 and ask for the funding to be released in 2025 (for expenses that need to be incurred in that year, such as creating the conference website) or for it to be released in 2026.</li> <li>The eligible expenses are very diverse. For example, technical support from an external body that is involved in the organisation, cover the costs of creating the event's corporate identity, pay for travel expenses for guest speakers...</li> <li>The grant is higher if the event is international. The maximum grant that can be awarded is €3,000.</li> </ul><p>  </p><p><b>Modality B.3. Visit of research staff from other centres </b>(<i>Visita de personal investigador de otros centros</i>)</p><p>  </p><ul> <li>To cover the travelling and accommodation costs of persons visiting the group. A grant may be requested for the simultaneous participation of more than one person if this takes place in the context of a working meeting, workshop, joint seminar, etc.</li> <li>Only one grant will be awarded per research group.</li> <li>The visit must necessarily include an activity such as a lecture, seminar or workshop.</li> <li>The maximum grant is €1,000 and the amount depends on where the invited person(s) is travelling from.</li> </ul>
