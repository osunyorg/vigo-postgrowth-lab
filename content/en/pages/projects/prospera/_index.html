    <p><i>Prospering without growth</i>  <i>Science, Technology and Innovation in a post-growth era (2021-2025)</i></p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>What levels of technological complexity can we reach in a non-growing economy? The feasibility and desirability of endless economic growth is increasingly being questioned by scholars and activists. While envisioning alternative economic models is key to assure the sustainability and wellbeing of present and future generations, few studies have analysed what might be the role of ‘innovation’ in a post- growth era. Innovating has become the imperative for the survival and expansion of any form of organisation. But this ‘ innovate or die mania ’ underpins assumptions – such as technological determinism and productivism that neglect the socially constructed character of technological development, its politics and its capacity to enable just and equitable societies but also dystopian technocratic futures. PROSPERA posits that untangling innovation from growth is key to imagining a post-growth era. If growth is going to be unsustainable, we need new narratives for innovation that would accordingly also have to change and increase the scope of the innovation concept itself, beyond technology, into cultural and institutional change, and indeed social life and social order. PROSPERA attempted to address the following questions, rarely asked by management and organization scholars:  <br> How organizations would look like in a different paradigm, in a system that is not based on and doesn’t not rely on endless growth?  <br> Under which conditions STI without growth would be able to flourish?  <br> What levels of technological complexity can we reach in a non-growing economy?  <br> What policies, infrastructures and organizational forms are needed or are more likely to facilitate this new paradigm of STI? </p>  <p>  Today a lack of realism no longer consists in advocating greater well-being through the inversion of growth and the subversion of the prevailing way of life. Lack of realism consists in imagining that economic growth can still bring about increased human welfare, and indeed that it is still physically possible. <br>André Gorz</p>  <p> Research Outcomes  <br>Theoretical foundations of Post-growth Innovation </p>  <p> Post Growth Innovation</p>  <p>Resisting the Pursuit of Endless Economic Growth Available <br>on Open Access  here      Post <br>growth and degrowth scholars argue that we cannot reduce CO2 emissions fast <br>enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees while continuing economic growth. <br>We face a choice: either we innovate how to scale down production and <br>consumption equitably, or we risk severe environmental and social consequences. Yet the role of innovation <br>remains largely unexplored within contemporary post growth debates. This book <br>fills that gap, examining the narratives, processes, and practices needed to <br>break free from the growth imperative. It offers a bridge for understanding the <br>far-reaching implications of technological and scientific advancements in a <br>society that challenges economic growth as its central focus.           </p>  <p>Cover of the book: Post-growth Innovation</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Senior researcher</p>  <p>Senior researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p> Grant  <br>“Prospering without growth: Science, Technology and Innovation in a post-growth era” is a project funded by the ERC Starting Grant 2020.
