    <p>  <br>What levels of technological complexity can we reach in a non-growing economy? The feasibility and desirability of endless economic growth is increasingly being questioned by scholars and activists. While envisioning alternative economic models is key to assure the sustainability and wellbeing of present and future generations, few studies have analysed what might be the role of ‘innovation’ in a post- growth era. Innovating has become the imperative for the survival and expansion of any form of organisation. But this ‘ innovate or die mania ’ underpins assumptions – such as technological determinism and productivism that neglect the socially constructed character of technological development, its politics and its capacity to enable just and equitable societies but also dystopian technocratic futures. PROSPERA posits that untangling innovation from growth is key to imagining a post-growth era. If growth is going to be unsustainable, we need new narratives for innovation that would accordingly also have to change and increase the scope of the innovation concept itself, beyond technology, into cultural and institutional change, and indeed social life and social order. PROSPERA attempted to address the following questions, rarely asked by management and organization scholars:  <br> How organizations would look like in a different paradigm, in a system that is not based on and doesn’t not rely on endless growth?  <br> Under which conditions STI without growth would be able to flourish?  <br> What levels of technological complexity can we reach in a non-growing economy?  <br> What policies, infrastructures and organizational forms are needed or are more likely to facilitate this new paradigm of STI? </p>  <p> Research Outcomes   <br>Post Growth Innovation Resisting the Pursuit of Endless Economic Growth <br>Open <br>Access  here   ost <br>growth and degrowth scholars argue that we cannot reduce CO2 emissions fast <br>enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees while continuing economic growth. <br>We face a choice: either we innovate how to scale down production and <br>consumption equitably, or we risk severe environmental and social consequences. Yet the role of innovation <br>remains largely unexplored within contemporary post growth debates. This book <br>fills that gap, examining the narratives, processes, and practices needed to <br>break free from the growth imperative. It offers a bridge for understanding the <br>far-reaching implications of technological and scientific advancements in a <br>society that challenges economic growth as its central focus.</p>  <p>book's cover</p>  <p>Critiques of Growth: An introduction <br>Open Access  here      The eBook synthesises <br>the main criticism levelled against the growth paradigm.
