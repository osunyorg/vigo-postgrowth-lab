    <p>  <br>The SDG Platform is a project funded by the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and Agenda 2030, aiming to promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the local level through the co-creation of policies based on scientific evidence. To achieve this, an  open digital platform  is being developed and launched to monitor the SDGs at the municipal level across Spain. The initiative includes a pilot project in the city of Pontevedra to drive the platform, consisting of two actions: <br> A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT <br> A citizen science project will be launched in schools in Pontevedra. Teaching staff and students will participate in scientific research to help clarify how to address the climate crisis at the municipal level. The SDG Platform research team will support participants to ensure the rigour of the entire process, so that the results can be integrated into the digital platform. In this way, these results can inform collective decision-making. The citizen science methodology will be designed for replication in other locations and schools. <br> A LOCAL DEVELOPMENT GROUP (LDG) <br> The LDG aims to provide a stable space for meeting and dialogue to enable informed and collective decisions. It is a pioneering initiative in Galicia, seeking to lay the foundations for active citizen participation in response to the major challenges of the 21st century. The pilot project will be carried out in Pontevedra City Council, with a working group comprising people representing the diversity of its society, including vulnerable groups. Through several working sessions based on innovative participatory methodologies, the LDG will develop proposals for measures and recommendations to address the climate crisis at the municipal level. These recommendations will serve as a guide for the municipal government.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>This material has been produced with the financial support of the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and the 2030 Agenda.
