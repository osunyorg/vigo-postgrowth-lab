  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The  Right to Repair (R2R) movement  <br>seeks to challenge restrictive repair policies imposed by manufacturers, <br>advocating for legislative measures that grant consumers and independent <br>technicians access to repair tools, documentation, and spare parts. This <br>project explores how the R2R movement can  contribute to a transition <br>towards a postgrowth society , in which technological and <br>economic systems prioritize sustainability over perpetual growth. Using  controversy mapping , <br>the research investigates the  complexity of R2R debates , <br>analyzing the diverse motivations, values, and strategies of activists, <br>policymakers, and industry representatives. It examines how  corporate <br>lobbying and policy negotiations influence R2R legislation  and <br>identifies alternative policy frameworks that align with postgrowth principles. By integrating insights from  postgrowth <br>economics, technology studies, and repair activism , the project <br> challenges <br>mainstream interpretations of R2R as a purely technical issue , <br>highlighting its broader  cultural, economic, and political dimensions . <br>Ultimately, it aims to inform policies that promote repairability as a  key strategy <br>for sustainability, waste reduction, and consumer empowerment . This <br>project examines the  Right to Repair (R2R)  movement, focusing on its <br>role in  transitioning towards a postgrowth society —a model that <br>redefines the relationship between consumers, manufacturers, and technology. It <br>investigates how repair restrictions impact consumer rights, environmental <br>sustainability, and economic structures, particularly in the European Union <br>(EU). Main Objectives:  <br>   <br> Analyze the R2R movement in the EU , identifying the diverse motivations, values, <br>     and socio-technical imaginaries that shape the demands of its advocates. <br>     This challenges the view of R2R as a unified ideological movement, <br>     revealing its complexity and diversity​.  <br>   <br> Investigate interactions between R2R activists <br>     and EU institutions , <br>     assessing how corporate lobbying, grassroots activism, and policy-making <br>     shape the debate. The project explores why some R2R demands gain traction <br>     while others are sidelined​.  <br>   <br> Develop a postgrowth framework for R2R policies , integrating insights from postgrowth economics <br>     and sustainability studies to propose alternative pathways for technology <br>     governance beyond economic growth dependency​.  <br> </p>  <p> Through  controversy <br>mapping, qualitative interviews, and policy analysis , the project sheds <br>light on the dynamics between  activists, policymakers, and industry <br>stakeholders , offering practical recommendations for progressive R2R <br>policies.</p>  <p> Team members  <br>  </p>  <p>Project Coordinator</p>  <p>Project Coordinator</p>  <p>Posdoctoral Researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p> News  <br> Grant "Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento" (Knowledge Generation Projects) funded by:  </p>
