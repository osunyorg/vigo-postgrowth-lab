  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The Right to Repair (R2R) movement <br>seeks to challenge restrictive repair policies imposed by manufacturers, <br>advocating for legislative measures that grant consumers and independent <br>technicians access to repair tools, documentation, and spare parts. This <br>project explores how the R2R movement can contribute to a transition <br>towards a postgrowth society, in which technological and <br>economic systems prioritize sustainability over perpetual growth.Using controversy mapping, <br>the research investigates the complexity of R2R debates, <br>analyzing the diverse motivations, values, and strategies of activists, <br>policymakers, and industry representatives. It examines how corporate <br>lobbying and policy negotiations influence R2R legislation and <br>identifies alternative policy frameworks that align with postgrowth principles.By integrating insights from postgrowth <br>economics, technology studies, and repair activism, the project <br>challenges <br>mainstream interpretations of R2R as a purely technical issue, <br>highlighting its broader cultural, economic, and political dimensions. <br>Ultimately, it aims to inform policies that promote repairability as a key strategy <br>for sustainability, waste reduction, and consumer empowerment.This <br>project examines the Right to Repair (R2R) movement, focusing on its <br>role in transitioning towards a postgrowth society—a model that <br>redefines the relationship between consumers, manufacturers, and technology. It <br>investigates how repair restrictions impact consumer rights, environmental <br>sustainability, and economic structures, particularly in the European Union <br>(EU).Main Objectives: <br>  <br>Analyze the R2R movement in the EU, identifying the diverse motivations, values, <br>     and socio-technical imaginaries that shape the demands of its advocates. <br>     This challenges the view of R2R as a unified ideological movement, <br>     revealing its complexity and diversity​. <br>  <br>Investigate interactions between R2R activists <br>     and EU institutions, <br>     assessing how corporate lobbying, grassroots activism, and policy-making <br>     shape the debate. The project explores why some R2R demands gain traction <br>     while others are sidelined​. <br>  <br>Develop a postgrowth framework for R2R policies, integrating insights from postgrowth economics <br>     and sustainability studies to propose alternative pathways for technology <br>     governance beyond economic growth dependency​.</p>  <p>Through controversy <br>mapping, qualitative interviews, and policy analysis, the project sheds <br>light on the dynamics between activists, policymakers, and industry <br>stakeholders, offering practical recommendations for progressive R2R <br>policies.</p>
