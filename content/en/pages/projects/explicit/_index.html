        <p>The circular economy represents a new paradigm that can push         the frontiers of sustainable development by reshaping the         relationships between ecological systems, economic activities         and social justice.<br>         <br>         While there is a consensus that the transition to a CE could         promote a more sustainable future, there is so far a lack of         discussion on how a truly circular economic system should be         organised. Most of the current academic literature portrays the         transition to a CE as a straightforward, neutral and apolitical         process, implicitly characterised by a techno-optimistic and         eco-modernist stance.<br>         <br>         Against this background, this project calls for opening a debate         to deconstruct the increasingly hegemonic discourse on the CE         based on a technocratic approach and reshape it by incorporating         normative and political dimensions, considering a variety of         plausible CE futures and discussing their implications for the         organisation of production and distribution networks, while         engaging a broad range of stakeholders.<br>         <br>         The project will involve a broad range of 5 academic and 5         non-academic partners to ensure that the project will be able to         realise relevant knowledge transfer through secondment         mechanisms.<br>         <br>         The consortium will be led by the Universita degli studi di         Napoli Parthenope (Italy)<br></p>
