    <p>  <br>The circular economy represents a new paradigm that can push <br>        the frontiers of sustainable development by reshaping the <br>        relationships between ecological systems, economic activities <br>        and social justice.  <br>          <br>        While there is a consensus that the transition to a CE could <br>        promote a more sustainable future, there is so far a lack of <br>        discussion on how a truly circular economic system should be <br>        organised. Most of the current academic literature portrays the <br>        transition to a CE as a straightforward, neutral and apolitical <br>        process, implicitly characterised by a techno-optimistic and <br>        eco-modernist stance.  <br>          <br>        Against this background, this project calls for opening a debate <br>        to deconstruct the increasingly hegemonic discourse on the CE <br>        based on a technocratic approach and reshape it by incorporating <br>        normative and political dimensions, considering a variety of <br>        plausible CE futures and discussing their implications for the <br>        organisation of production and distribution networks, while <br>        engaging a broad range of stakeholders.  <br>          <br>        The project will involve a broad range of 5 academic and 5 <br>        non-academic partners to ensure that the project will be able to <br>        realise relevant knowledge transfer through secondment <br>        mechanisms.  <br>          <br>        The consortium will be led by the Universita degli studi di <br>        Napoli Parthenope (Italy) <br>More info about the project can be foud  here</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Senior researcher</p>  <p>Senior researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p> Duration  <br>01/01/2023 to 31/12/2025</p>  <p> Grant  <br>This project is funded by European Union, under the program Horizon-MSCA-2021-SE-01.Grant Agreement No 101086465.
