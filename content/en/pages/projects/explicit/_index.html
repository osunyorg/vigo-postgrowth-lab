        <p>Circular Economy (CE) represents a new paradigm that is capable of pushing the frontiers of sustainable development by transforming the relationships between ecological systems and economic activities.</p><p>However, while there is common agreement that the transition towards a CE could foster more sustainable futures, there is a lack of discussion about how a truly circular economic system should be organised. Most of the current literature on CE fails to recognise this, presenting the transition towards a CE as a straightforward, neutral, and apolitical process, implicitly characterised by a techno-optimistic and eco-modernist stance.</p><p>Within this context, this project calls for opening up a debate to deconstruct the increasingly hegemonic discourse of Circular Economy based on a technocratic approach and reconstruct it by embedding normative and political dimensions, looking at a plurality of plausible CE futures, and discussing their implications in terms of the organisation of production and distribution networks, also involving a wide set of stakeholders.</p><p>The project will involve a wide array of 5 academic an 4 nonacademic partners to ensure that the project will be capable of realising relevant knowledge transfer through secondment mechanisms.</p><p>The consortium is led by Universita degli studi di Napoli Parthenope (Italy)</p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2025</p><p>More info about the project <a href="http://explicit-se.net/">here</a></p><p><b><i>This project is funded by European Union, under the program Horizon-MSCA-2021-SE-01. Grant Agreement No 101086465. Total Budget: 349 600.00 €</i></b></p>
