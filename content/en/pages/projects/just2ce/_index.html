  body: >-
    <p>  <br>JUST2CE aims at understanding, in a critical and thoughtful way, under which conditions a responsible, inclusive and socially just transition to a circular economy is possible and desirable, what technical, geopolitical and social factors can enable or hamper such transformation and how these aspects can contribute to the development of transitional policy measures. The project will identify enablers and barriers to CE in a number of key strategic sectors – selected among those indicated by the EU Action Plan for Circular Economy – such as food production and waste, water management, critical raw materials and production in complex global supply chains. The results of this analysis will be used to develop a decision support system and macroeconomics analytical tools to design new or improve existing CE practices. <br>More info about the project is available at  JUST2CE webpage</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Posdoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>Predoctoral researcher</p>  <p>R&D Manager</p>  <p> Grant  <br>101003491 Grant Agreement.
