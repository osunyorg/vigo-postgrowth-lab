They address issues such as structural factors that hinder or <br>promote equitable ecological change, mechanisms to ensure gender equality and <br>other important challenges of our time.

The project aims to reach the widest possible audience, paying <br>particular attention to three groups with the greatest difficulties in <br>accessing this content:  young people  between 16 and 24 years old,  people <br>at risk of social exclusion  and groups with  visual functional diversity . <br> T·I·A·S <br>creates informative versions of certain academic texts in different formats so <br>that they are accessible to a non-academic audience, while maintaining the <br>rigour of the original works.
