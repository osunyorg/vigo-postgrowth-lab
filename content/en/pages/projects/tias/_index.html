    <p>  <br>The  social sciences  analyse economic, social, political and <br>cultural aspects that are fundamental to the development and cohesion of our <br>societies. They address issues such as structural factors that hinder or <br>promote equitable ecological change, mechanisms to ensure gender equality and <br>other important challenges of our time. Yet the notion persists that only what <br>is done in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects, in a lab <br>or using sophisticated technology is 'science'. <br>  <br>The T·I·A·S ( This Is Also Science ) project was born out of the <br>need to  bring the results of social science research closer to the public . <br>The main aim of the project is to  improve knowledge and understanding of <br>science and technology  in this field, especially in relation to issues of  postgrowth <br>and ecological economics , thus helping to build bridges between the social <br>science field, current challenges and society. The project aims to reach the widest possible audience, paying <br>particular attention to three groups with the greatest difficulties in <br>accessing this content:  young people  between 16 and 24 years old,  people <br>at risk of social exclusion  and groups with  visual functional diversity . <br> T·I·A·S <br>creates informative versions of certain academic texts in different formats so <br>that they are accessible to a non-academic audience, while maintaining the <br>rigour of the original works. This results in the  T·I·A·S Magazine , <br>which is published at regular intervals and contains various dissemination articles <br>based on academic work, as well as the  T·I·A·S Audio-magazine , a podcast <br>version of some of the articles published in the magazine. 20653).        <br> The project is co-financed by the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology - FECYT (FCT-24-20653)</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>
