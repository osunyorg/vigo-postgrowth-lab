    <p>  <br>The CoBlue <br>project (Co-creating knowledge and politics in the blue economy) is an <br>ORRI (Open Responsible Research and Innovation) initiative that aims to contribute <br>to the Starfish 2030 - Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030 mission. The <br>project is funded by the European Reinforcing Project, which in turn is <br>supported by the Horizon Europe programme.The main <br>objective of the project is to develop, test and refine a methodology for <br>multi-stakeholder engagement. To achieve this, the project will carry out a <br>research-action to activate and mobilise the community interested in or <br>affected by the development of offshore wind energy in south-west Galicia.At the end <br>of the project, the aim is to obtain knowledge on how to carry out truly <br>inclusive multi-stakeholder processes, a practical guide for the development of <br>multi-stakeholder participation processes and a policy brief with policy <br>recommendations on how to integrate ORRI into the development of offshore <br>wind energy and adapt national and regional legislation to European standards.</p>  <p>The project will run for one year until December 2025 in partnership between the University of Vigo and the Research Centre for Territory, Transport and Environment (CITTA-Porto). Within UVigo, the project involves the collaboration of different research groups:  Post-Growth Innovation <br>Lab, Future Oceans Lab, Governance and Economics Research Network and <br>Biological Oceanography.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Project Coordinator</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>
