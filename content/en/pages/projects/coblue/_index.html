    <p>  <br>The CoBlue <br>project ( Co-creating knowledge and politics in the blue economy ) is an <br>ORRI (Open Responsible Research and Innovation) initiative that aims to  contribute <br>to the Starfish 2030  - Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030 mission. The <br>project is funded by the European Reinforcing Project, which in turn is <br>supported by the Horizon Europe programme. The main <br>objective of the project is to  develop, test and refine a methodology for <br>multi-stakeholder engagement . To achieve this, the project will carry out a <br>research-action to activate and mobilise the community interested in or <br>affected by the development of offshore wind energy in south-west Galicia. At the end <br>of the project, the aim is to obtain knowledge on how to carry out truly <br>inclusive multi-stakeholder processes, a practical guide for the development of <br>multi-stakeholder participation processes and a policy brief with  policy <br>recommendations on how to integrate ORRI  into the development of offshore <br>wind energy and adapt national and regional legislation to European standards. </p>  <p> The project will run for one year until December 2025  in partnership between the University of Vigo and the Research Centre for Territory, Transport and Environment (CITTA-Porto) . Within UVigo, the project involves the collaboration of different research groups:  Post-Growth Innovation <br>Lab,  Future Oceans Lab ,  Governance and Economics Research Network  and <br> Biological Oceanography .</p>  <p> Project members  <br>  </p>  <p>Project Coordinator</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p>Team member</p>  <p> ORRI Tool  <br>   <br>Guidelines for Conducting Inclusive Multi-Stakeholder Engagement actions</p>  <p>•	Methodological Guide for Multi-stakeholders Co-creative Actions for Formulating Policy Recommendations</p>  <p> ORRI action outcomes  <br>   <br>Policy brief (English)</p>  <p>Policy brief (Spanish)</p>  <p>Policy brief (Galician)</p>
