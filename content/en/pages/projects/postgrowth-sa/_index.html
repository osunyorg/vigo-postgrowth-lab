        <p>By applying methods of open, responsible research and innovation, the project aims to define new standards for science and thus contribute to the Spanish 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the European Missions.</p><p>The project uses an innovative method to bring science closer to the public. The Posgrowth S.A. actions are aimed in particular at high school students, who become social scientists during the school year and contribute to the research process as part of the action.</p><p>The project is coordinated by the Postgrowth Innovation Lab at the University of Vigo and co-financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT).</p><p>Two actions have been carried out so far. <b>Postgrowth S.A.: Pontevedra </b>aims to analyse how to achieve a just ecological transition in cities and is carried out in collaboration with Pontevedra City Council. <b>Postgrowth S.A.: Vigo</b> aims to study how to achieve a just ecological transition in the blue economy and is being carried out in collaboration with Vigo City Council.</p>
