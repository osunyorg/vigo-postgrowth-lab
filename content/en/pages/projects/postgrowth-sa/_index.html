        <p>Postgrowth S. A.: Pontevedra is a citizen science project in the field of social sciences that aims to co-create the city of the future, a just and sustainable city designed for community living and enjoyment. The project involves students and teachers from secondary and high schools in the municipality of Pontevedra. Through the study of different local cases, the students and teachers will participate in the exploration of creative solutions to the environmental and social challenges we are currently facing.<br>  <br> The project will start in September 2023 and end with the participation of students and teachers in the 10th International Degrowth Conference and the 15th Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics, which will take place in June 2024 in the city of Pontevedra. Throughout the course, there will be a combination of face-to-face sessions and ongoing guidance from the University of Vigo work team. These sessions will form the basis for collaboration between students and teachers in the design of the research protocol, data collection, analysis and interpretation, and the dissemination and sharing of results. The latter will mainly take place in the Youth Space of the conference.<br>  <br> Therefore, the project offers a unique opportunity to involve students in a real research process in the framework of a European funded project (ERC Starting Grant PROSPERA, GA 947713). At the end of the course, all participants will receive an accreditation for their participation in the project. At the same time, the citizen science process will be monitored to generate knowledge about citizen science itself and will be captured in a documentary video. This will facilitate communication and enable the replicability of this pioneering project in other cities.<br>  <br><br></p>
