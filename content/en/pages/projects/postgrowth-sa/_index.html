    <p>                     Co-creative citizen science project that involves students in the generation of knowledge through their voluntary participation in the research process.       </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>By applying methods of open, responsible <br>research and innovation, the project aims to define new standards for science <br>and thus contribute to the Spanish 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and <br>the European Missions. The project uses an innovative method to bring <br>science closer to the public. The Posgrowth S.A. actions are aimed in <br>particular at high school students, who become social scientists during the <br>school year and contribute to the research process as part of the action. The project is coordinated by the Postgrowth <br>Innovation Lab at the University of Vigo and co-financed by the Foundation for <br>Science and Technology (FECYT). Two actions have been carried out so far. <br> Postgrowth S.A.: Pontevedra  aims to analyse how to achieve a just ecological <br>transition in cities and is carried out in collaboration with Pontevedra City <br>Council.  Postgrowth S.A.: Vigo  aims to study how to achieve a just ecological <br>transition in the blue economy and is being carried out in collaboration with <br>Vigo City Council. <br>To find out more about the Postgrowth S.A.: <br>Pontevedra project, visit the project website:  https://postgrowthsa.webs.uvigo.es/postgrowthsapontevedra/ </p>  <p> To find out more about the Postgrowth S.A.: <br>Vigo project, visit the project website:  https://postgrowthsa.webs.uvigo.es/postgrowthsavigo/</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Coordinator</p>  <p>Dissemination and knowledge transfer manager</p>  <p> Duration  <br>September 2023 - November 2025</p>
