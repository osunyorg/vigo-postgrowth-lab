By promoting repairability, R2R aims to reduce electronic waste, limit resource extraction, and foster sustainable consumption practices. This project will map the <b>multiple perspectives surrounding the R2R debate</b> and analyse how these perspectives influence EU legislation on sustainability and circular economy. While mapping out these different perspectives is essential, the project places a strong focus on <b>how they are being integrated in actual R2R legislation</b>, particularly within the <b>European Union</b>. Finally, the project will analyse these dynamics in terms of their <b>alignment with the transition to a post-growth economy.</b></p><p><b>PhD CANDIDATE PROFILE</b></p><ul> <p>We welcome applicants from any academic background—be it social sciences, humanities, or natural sciences—as long as they possess the necessary skills and motivations required for the project.
