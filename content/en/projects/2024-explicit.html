    <p>Duration  <br>   <br>01/01/2023 to 31/12/2025</p>  <p> Summary  <br>   <br>Circular Economy (CE) represents a new paradigm that is capable of pushing the frontiers of sustainable development by transforming the relationships between ecological systems and economic activities. However, while there is common agreement that the transition towards a CE could foster more sustainable futures, there is a lack of discussion about how a truly circular economic system should be organised. Most of the current literature on CE fails to recognise this, presenting the transition towards a CE as a straightforward, neutral, and apolitical process, implicitly characterised by a techno-optimistic and eco-modernist stance. Within this context, this project calls for opening up a debate to deconstruct the increasingly hegemonic discourse of Circular Economy based on a technocratic approach and reconstruct it by embedding normative and political dimensions, looking at a plurality of plausible CE futures, and discussing their implications in terms of the organisation of production and distribution networks, also involving a wide set of stakeholders. The project will involve a wide array of 5 academic an 4 nonacademic partners to ensure that the project will be capable of realising relevant knowledge transfer through secondment mechanisms. The consortium is led by Universita degli studi di Napoli Parthenope (Italy) <br>More info about the project  here</p>  <p> Grant  <br>   <br>This project is funded by European Union, under the program Horizon-MSCA-2021-SE-01.Grant Agreement No 101086465. Total Budget: 349 600.00 €</p>
