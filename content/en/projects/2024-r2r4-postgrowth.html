  “A right to repair for a post-growth society: Controversies, opportunities and challenges” This project aims at elucidating how ongoing debates and policies about the “right to repair” can be conceptualised and implemented to support a transition towards a postgrowth society.

        <p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Javier Lloveras<br></p><p><strong>Supervisor</strong><em>:</em> Mario Pansera</p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 01/09/2022 to 31/08/2024</p><p>More info about the project coming soon</p><p>This project is funded by European Union, under the program Horizon-MSCA-2021-PF-01. Grant Agreement No 101066896. Budget: 181 152.96€</p><p>The need to continuously stimulate consumer demand within saturated capitalist markets has driven manufacturers of electronic equipment to adopt dubious marketing practices associated with planned obsolescence (e. g. they might artificially shorten the lifespan of their products, downplay issues of durability and maintenance during the design stage, and on). The social and ecological costs of these trends are enormous, and the world is currently on track to produce 74 million tonnes of e-waste by 2030. In this context, there is mounting pressure on manufacturers and policy-makers to facilitate consumers the “right to repair” (R2R) their electronic devices, rather than relying on the manufacturer to make/authorise repairs with proprietary components. This demand has sparked a controversy concerning the limits of the R2R, with large multinational corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, or John Deere disputing this concept on economic, technical, legal or safety grounds. </p><p>In this regard, the present project aims at elucidating how ongoing debates and policies about the “right to repair” can be conceptualised and implemented to support a transition towards a postgrowth society. </p>
